Come away to the skies, my belovèd, arise 
And rejoice in the day you were born; 
On this festival day, come exulting away, 
And with singing to Zion return. 

Now with singing and praise let us spend all the days 
By our heavenly Father bestowed, 
While His grace we receive from His bounty, and live 
To the honor and glory of God! 

For the glory we were first created to share, 
Both the nature and kingdom divine, 
Now created again that our lives may remain 
Throughout time and eternity Thine.

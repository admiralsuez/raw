My Jesus, My Saviour Lord
there is none like You
All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love
My comfort, My shelter,
tower of refuge and strength,
Let every breath, All that I am
never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord all the earth
let us sing
power and majesty praise to the king
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of Your name

I sing for joy at the works
of Your hands
forever I'll love You forever I'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise
I have in You

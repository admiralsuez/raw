Everlasting God,
Creator of the earth
You do not get tired
You do not grow weak

You give me strength
When I'm weary
When I am in need.
You give me power.

I will mount up on wings like eagles
I will run and not get tired
I will walk and not get weary
I will mount up and soar….
On eagles wings.

Everlasting God
Creator of the earth
You do not get tired
You do not grow weak

When I thirst for more
You make springs of water
When I can not see
You lead the way

I will mount up on wings like eagles
I will run and not get tired
I will walk and not get weary
I will mount up and soar….
On eagles wings.

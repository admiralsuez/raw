Jesus, draw me close.
Closer, Lord to You.
Let the world around me, fade away.
Jesus, draw me close.
Closer, Lord to You.
For I desire to worship, and obey!

Jesus, Draw Me Close

As we seek your face,
May we know your heart
Feel your presence, acceptance
As we seek your face
At your feet we fall, sovereign Lord
We cry holy, holy 
At Your feet we fall.

Jesus, draw me close.
Closer, Lord to You.
Let the world around me, fade away.
Jesus, draw me close.
Closer, Lord to You.
For I desire to worship, and obey!

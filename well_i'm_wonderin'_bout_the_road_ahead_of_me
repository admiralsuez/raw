Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me, 
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me, 
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
And I'm wonderin' bout the way I spend my days, 
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
Wonderin' if there's still a need from you. 

(Uh) We didn't know what to do 
You were lookin at me and I was lookin at you 
We were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God 
For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts 
And yo, without a second to think 
We was turned around and we were makin that bank 
And we was ridin in style clockin them miles 
With the songs that He put down deep in our hearts 

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me, 
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me, 
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
And I'm wonderin' bout the way I spend my days, 
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
Wonderin' if there's still a need from you. 

Yeah, it's been a minute my friend 
And you and I, we never thought it would end 
But when we stopped to pause and opened the doors 
There's some dreams that were put down deep in my heart 
But hey, I'm always thinkin of you 
And I can see your influence in the things that I do 
Think and thin, forever my friend 
Cause there's a vine that was put down deep in our hearts 

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me, 
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me, 
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
And I'm wonderin' bout the way I spend my days, 
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
Wonderin' if there's still a need from you. 

We didn't know what to do 
You were lookin at me and I was lookin at you 
We were thinkin' it odd but we were thankin' our God 
For the hope that He put down deep in our hearts 
And hey, if I could turn back time 
I wouldn't touch a day I wouldn't shade the shine 
Cause I do know this, I won't be remiss with the memories locked away in my heart (locked away in my heart..) 

Well I'm wonderin' bout the road ahead of me, 
Wonderin' bout the things you said to me, 
Wonderin' if these dreams will ever do. 
And I'm wonderin' bout the way I spend my days, 
Wonderin' if it's even worth the chase, 
Wonderin' if there's still a need from you.

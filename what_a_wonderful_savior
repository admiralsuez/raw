What a wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, my Lord!

Christ has for sin atonement made
What a wonderful Savior!
We are redeemed, the price is paid
What a wonderful Savior!

What a wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, my Lord!

I praise Him for the cleansing blood
What a wonderful Savior!
That reconciled my soul to God
What a wonderful Savior!

What a wonderful Savior
Is Jesus, my Jesus!
What a wonderful Savior 
Is Jesus, my Lord.

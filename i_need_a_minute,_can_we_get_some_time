I need a minute, can we get some time?
We both know we don't see eye to eye
I know it's hard on us when we disagree
But don't you think that you and me could take a chance?

And love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to
Love somebody, take a chance and pass it on
You could be the one to love

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

I had a dream just the other day
With blinded eyes we let real love guide the way
Nobody felt we had to look the same or talk the game
We found true beauty and we weren't afraid to go ahead

And love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to
Love somebody, take a chance and pass it on
You could be the one to
Love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to love

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

If Mandisa ain't changed your mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme
But she gave me eight to flow and translate
Recalibrate, end all debates

'Cause this bomb is about to drop, y'all
Diverse City just can't be stopped
So here we go, come, check the show
Come one, come all, come overflow with love

Yeah, love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to
Love somebody, take a chance and pass it on
You could be the one to

Love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Go ahead and love somebody, somebody needs you
You could be the one to
Love somebody, take a chance and pass it on
You could be the one to love

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Come on, if Mandisa ain't changed your mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme
If Mandisa ain't changed your mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme

If Mandisa ain't changed your mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme
If Mandisa ain't changed your mind
It oughta be flipped by the end of this rhyme

We will worship the Lamb of glory.
We will worship the King of kings.
We will worship the Lamb of glory.
We will worship the King.

We bless the name
Of the Lamb of glory.
We bless the name
Of the King of Kings.

We bless the name
Of the Lamb of glory.
We bless the name of the King.

And with our hands lifted high,
We will worship and sing.
With our hands lifted high
We come before You rejoicing.

With our hands lifted high
To the sky,
When the world
Wonders why,

We’ll just tell them
We’re loving our King.
We’ll just tell them
We’re loving our King.

We will worship the Lamb of glory.
We will worship the King of kings.
We will worship the Lamb of glory.
We will worship the King.

And with our hands lifted high,
We will worship and sing.
With our hands lifted high
We come before You rejoicing.

With our hands lifted high
To the sky,
When the world
Wonders why,

We’ll just tell them
We’re loving our King.
We’ll just tell them
We’re loving our King.

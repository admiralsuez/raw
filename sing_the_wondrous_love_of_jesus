Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed
He値l prepare for us a place.

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing
That will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We値l sing and shout the victory.

While we walk the pilgrim pathway
Clouds will over-spread the sky;
But when travelling days are over
Not a shadow, not a sigh.

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing
That will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We値l sing and shout the victory.

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of life repay.

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing
That will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We値l sing and shout the victory.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we値l behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing
That will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We値l sing and shout the victory.

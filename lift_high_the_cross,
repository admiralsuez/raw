Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

Come, Christians, follow
Where our Savior trod,
Our King victorious,
Christ, the Son of God.

Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

Led on their way by
This triumphant sigh,
The hosts of God in
Conquering ranks combine.

Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

O Lord, once lifted
On this glorious tree,
As Thou hast promised,
Draw men unto Thee.

Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

Set up Thy throne
That earth's despair may cease
Beneath the shadow
Of its healing peace.

Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

For Thy blest Cross
Which doth for all atone,
Creation's praises
Rise before Thy throne.

Lift high the Cross,
The love of Christ proclaim,
'Til all the world adore
His sacred Name.

Lead on, O King Eternal,
The day of march has come,
Henceforth in fields of conquest,
Your tents shall be our home.

Through days of preparation,
Your grace has made us strong,
And now, O King Eternal,
We lift our battle song.

Lead on, O King Eternal,
'Til sin's fierce war shall cease,
And holiness shall whisper
The sweet Amen of peace;

For not with swords loud clashing,
Nor roll of stirring drums,
With deeds of love and mercy
The heavenly kingdom comes.

Lead on, O King Eternal,
We follow, not with fears;
For gladness breaks like morning
Where'er Your face appears;

You cross is lifted o'er us;
We journey in its light:
The crown awaits the conquest;
Lead on, O God of might.

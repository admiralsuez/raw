Come on, ring those bells,
Light the Christmas tree,
Jesus is the King
Born for you and me.

Come on, ring those bells,
Everybody say,
“Jesus, we remember
This, Your birthday.”

Come on, ring those bells,
Light the Christmas tree,
Jesus is the King
Born for you and me.

Come on, ring those bells,
Everybody say,
“Jesus, we remember
This, Your birthday.”

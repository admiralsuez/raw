I'm so happy and 
Here's the reason why:
Jesus took my burdens all away.
Now I'm singing as the days go by,
Jesus took my burdens all away.

Once my heart was heavy
With a load of sin;
Jesus took the heavy load and
Gave me peace within.
Now I'm singing as the days go by.
Jesus took my burden all away.

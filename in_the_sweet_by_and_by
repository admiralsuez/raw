In the sweet by and by
We shall meet
On that beautiful shore;

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet
On that beautiful shore.

There's a land
That is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar,

For the Father waits
Over the way
To prepare us
A dwelling place there.

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet
On that beautiful shore;

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet
On that beautiful shore.

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest;
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days.

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

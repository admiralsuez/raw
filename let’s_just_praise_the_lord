Let's just praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

Let's just lift our hearts to heaven and praise the Lord;

Let's just praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!

Let's just lift our hearts to heaven and praise the Lord!

      

O we thank You for Your kindness, we thank You for Your love,

We have been in heavenly places, felt blessings from above;

We've been sharing all the good things, the family can afford,

Let's just turn our praise toward heaven and praise the Lord.

      

Just the precious name of Jesus is worthy of our praise,

Let us bow our knees before Him, our hands to heaven raise;

When He comes in clouds of glory, with Him to ever reign,

Let's just lift our happy voices, and praise His name.

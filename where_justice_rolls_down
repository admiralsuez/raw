Where justice rolls down
Like a mighty water,
And righteousness grows
Like an ever-flowing stream,

And mercy resounds
Like the waves on the ocean,
Let praises rise high
On the songs of the redeemed.

Where justice rolls down
Like a mighty water,
And righteousness grows
Like an ever-flowing stream,

And mercy resounds
Like the waves on the ocean,
Let praises rise high
On the songs of the redeemed.

There is a river
That streams from the temple,
Begins as a trickle
But ends in the sea.

As it grows,
Healing it will give.
Where it flows
Everything will live.

Where justice rolls down
Like a mighty water,
And righteousness grows
Like an ever-flowing stream,

And mercy resounds
Like the waves on the ocean,
Let praises rise high
On the songs of the redeemed.

Wade in the water
And feel the strong current,
Remember the stagnance
Of stale life before.

God is here,
Leave the past behind.
In these clear
Waters you will find:

Justice rolls down
Like a mighty water,
And righteousness grows
Like an ever-flowing stream,

And mercy resounds
Like the waves on the ocean,
Let praises rise high
On the songs of the redeemed.

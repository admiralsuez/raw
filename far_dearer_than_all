Far dearer than all
That the world can impart
Was the message
That came to my heart.

How that Jesus alone
For my sin did atone,
And Calvary covers it all.

Calvary covers it all,
My past with its sin and stain;
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there,
And Calvary covers it all.

The stripes that He bore
And the thorns that He wore
Told His mercy 
And love evermore.

And my heart bowed in shame
As I called on His name,
And Calvary covers it all.

Calvary covers it all,
My past with its sin and stain;
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there,
And Calvary covers it all.

How matchless the grace,
When I looked on the face
Of this Jesus,
My crucified Lord;

My redemption complete
I then found at His feet,
And Calvary covers it all.

Calvary covers it all,
My past with its sin and stain;
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there,
And Calvary covers it all.

How blessed the thought,
That my soul by Him bought,
Shall be His
In the glory on high;

Where with gladness and song
I’ll be one of the throng,
And Calvary covers it all.

Calvary covers it all,
My past with its sin and stain;
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there,
And Calvary covers it all.

Over the sunset mountains,
Someday I'll softly go;
Into the arms of Jesus,
He who has loved me so.

Over The Sunset Mountains

Over the sunset mountains
Heaven awaits for me,
Over the sunset mountains,
Jesus my Savior I'll see.

Toiling will all be ended,
Shadows will flee away;
Sorrow will be forgotten-
Oh, what a wonderful day!


Over the sunset mountains
Heaven awaits for me,
Over the sunset mountains,
Jesus my Savior I'll see.

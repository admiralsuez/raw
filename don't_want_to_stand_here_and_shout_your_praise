Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise 
And walk away and forget Your name 
I'll stand for you if it's all I do 
Cause there is none that compares to You 

And all I want in this lifetime is You 
And all I want in this whole world is you, is you

Tell the world that Jesus lives 
Tell the world that, tell the world that 
Tell the world that he died for them 
Tell the world that he lives again 

No longer I but Christ in me 
Cause it's the truth that set me free 
How could this world be a better place? 
But by thy mercy, by thy grace 

And all I want in this lifetime is You
And all I want in this whole world is you, you, you 

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You

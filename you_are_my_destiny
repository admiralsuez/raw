You are my destiny,
Living inside of me.
Now that You set me free,
I hunger for You.

Peace I’ve been longing for,
Flow through me now once more.
My heart’s an open door.
Proclaim to the world.

You are Holy, Holy;
Lord God Almighty.
We bow down before Thee
To worship Your name.

Jesus, Savior,
My heart is Yours, Lord.
Oh, pour out Your mercy;
Come and fill this place.

Your love and nothing less
Conquers my emptiness.
Unending faithfulness.
I lift up my hands and cry,

“Holy, Holy!
Lord God Almighty.”
We bow down before Thee
To worship Your name.

Jesus, Savior,
My heart is Yours, Lord.
Pour out Your mercy,
Come and fill this place.

You are my destiny,
Living inside of me.
Now that You set me free,

Peace I’ve been longing for,
Flow through me now once more.

You are Holy, Holy;
Lord God Almighty.
We bow down before Thee

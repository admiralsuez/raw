And I don’t have the strength of words,
To tell you truly how I feel!

Better Than

Your love is better than life!
Your love is better than life!
And I don’t have the strength of words,
To tell you truly how I feel!

My God, You are the only one for me!
For me, the only one for me!
My God, Your love is better than all other loves
And now you’re drawing me
And I just want to be, closer to You!

I am so glad
That our Father in heaven
Tells of His love
In the book He has given;

Wonderful things
In the Bible I see -
This is the dearest,
That Jesus loves me.

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Though I forget Him
And wander away,
Still He doth love me
Wherever I stray;

Back to His dear loving arms
Would I flee
When I remember
That Jesus loves me.

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

O if there's only
One song I can sing
When in His beauty
I see the great King,

This shall my song
In eternity be:
“O what a wonder,
That Jesus loves me!”

I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Give me oil in my lamp, keep me burning
Give me oil in my lamp, I pray
Give me oil in my lamp, keep my burning
Keep me burning till the break of day

Sing hosanna, sing hosanna
Sing hosanna to the King of kings
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna
Sing hosanna to the King

Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising

Give me peace in my heart, keep me resting

Give me love in my heart, keep me serving

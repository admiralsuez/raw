I have a song that Jesus gave me,
It was sent from heaven above;
There never was a sweeter melody,
‘Tis a melody of love.

In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody
With heaven's harmony,
In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody of love.

I love the Christ who died on Calvary,
For he washed my sins away;
He put within my heart a melody,
And I know it's there to stay.

In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody
With heaven's harmony,
In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody of love.

‘Twill be my endless theme in glory,
With the angels I will sing;
‘Twill be a song with glorious harmony,
When the courts of heaven ring.

In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody
With heaven's harmony,
In my heart there rings a melody,
There rings a melody of love.

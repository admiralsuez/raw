La historia nos ha dado una declaración que sobre vive a los tiempos
El villancico de estos reyes hace brillar el alma,
Que nos recuerda que el verdadero Rey ha nacido

(History has given us a proclamation which outlasts the ages
The Carol Of These Kings vibrates the soul
Reminding us that a true King is born)

Midnight strikes and awww
See them rushing through the stained doors
Like kids in a sugarcane store
Is this what they stood in rain for?
Suddenly, Isle 3
Stood a sight so angelically
Inhale voice to the sky
Hear the bells ring it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

No panic, no stress
Opposite security threat
'Cause their eyes declared peace be still
In the midst of hopelessness
On their knees all agree
To reconcile to the King of peace
Many voices, one plea
And you can hear them scream it goes:

Hark how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

So we're laying down our crowns when the carol bell sounds

Now behold the rich and poor
Neighboring and distant shore
A baby King existing more than
A manger in the Inn
The source of life for man
Whose glory lights the land
The remedy for sin in generation and again and again
We're thankful for gifts and the presents but
Give us the gift of your presence Sir (please)?
'Cause we all long to be
A symphony of royalty so with this we sing

We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we've traveled so far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star
And you can hear them scream they said:
Woooooooooo

So we're laying down our crowns
When the carol bell sounds
Following yonder star

Christmas is here...

So we're laying down our crowns
When the carol bell sounds

Following yonder star

Feliz Navidad a todos.
Recuerden que, el verdadero sentido de la Navidad,
Es el nacimiento de nuestro Señor Jesucristo

(Merry Christmas to all
Remember the true meaning of Christmas is
The birth of our Lord Jesus Christ)

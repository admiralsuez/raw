In your presence
There is fullness of joy
At your right hand
There are pleasures evermore
You surround us
With your favour oh Lord
The earth is filled with your goodness
The earth is filled with your Love.

Exceedingly, abundantly
For above all we
Could ever ask or think
Exceedingly, abundantly
You give us all things
To enjoy

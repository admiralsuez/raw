As the earth softly awakes,
There is peace and stillness.
And the sound of the dawn
Echoes life begun anew.

Morning light casts soft shadows,
There is coolness in the air.
And the beauty that is all around us
Is God's voice if we dare to listen.

Like the dawn of life itself,
This day brings a new beginning.
What has come before is past
And this day is rebirth.

What we choose is up to us,
Whether is be joy or sadness.
And this day is our gift
It is life; life's reality.

Like the dawn of life itself,
This day brings a new beginning.
What has come before is past
And this day is rebirth.

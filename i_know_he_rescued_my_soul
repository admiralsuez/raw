I know he rescued my soul
His blood has covered my sins
I believe, I believe

My shame he's taken away
My pain is healed in his name
I believe, I believe

I'll raise a banner, (oh.. hoh) cause my lord
Has conquered the grave

My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives
My redeemer lives, my redeemer lives

You lift my burden, I'll rise with you
I'm dancing on this mountain top
To see your kingdom come

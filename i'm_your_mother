I'M YOUR MOTHER (Lyrics: Marty Rotella & Ed Sansanelli)
I'm your Mother, give your love to me. Put your trust in me, I'm your Mother.
I'm your Mother, God gave you to me, I gave Him to you, I'm your Mother.
Joseph and I made ready, a stable then a home, for the King of Kings my Son, Jesus the Lord.
I'm your Mother, honour me endlessly.  Please have faith in me.  I'm your Mother.
I'm your Mother, build a house for me, for the world to see, I'm your Mother. 
My home is your home, My house will be yours too.  Build for Me, so I can build in you.
Soi du Madre, Damme du amore, soi du confianza en mi soi du Madre
I'm your Mother, God gave you to me, I gave Him to you.  I'm your Mother,
Soi du Madre, I'm your Mother, soi du Madre, I'm your Mother ..etc to end 
Im your Mother.

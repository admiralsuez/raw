While by our sheep
We watched at night,
Glad tidings brought
An angel bright.

How great our joy!
Great our joy!
Joy, Joy, Joy! Joy, Joy, Joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

There shall be born,
So he did say,
In Bethlehem
A Child today.

How great our joy!
Great our joy!
Joy, Joy, Joy! Joy, Joy, Joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

There shall the Child
Lie in a stall,
This Child who shall
Redeem us all.

How great our joy!
Great our joy!
Joy, Joy, Joy! Joy, Joy, Joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

This gift of God
We’ll cherish well,
That ever joy
Our hearts shall fill.

How great our joy!
Great our joy!
Joy, Joy, Joy! Joy, Joy, Joy!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!
Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

Well the ducks go by,
Quack, Quack, Quack…
Things go up, Things go down,
And the world goes around and around…
And God lives on...

He made the birds, He made the bees
He made the flowers and,
		He made the trees
Can’t you see?
He made you and me.

He died for you, He died for me
He died to set all his people free, from sin
Won’t you let Him in?

Joyfully, joyfully
We are going up
To delicate our hearts
To the Lord
Joyfully, joyfully
We are going up
We came into His presence
With joy
(Repeat)

God has said He'd dwell
In the praises of His people
He is seeking those who'll
Worship Him in spirit and in truth
With our hands lift up
And our mouths filled with praise
With singing and dancing
And joy we celebrate
(Repeat chorus)

Hallelujah, hallelujah
We enter His presence with
Joy, joy, joy
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We dedicate our hearts
To the Lord
(Repeat 1st verse)
(Repeat chorus)

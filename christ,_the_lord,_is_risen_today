Christ, the Lord, is risen today, Alleluia! 
All on earth with angels say, Alleluia! 
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia! 
Sing, O heavens, and earth, reply, Alleluia! 

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia! 
Where, O death, is now your sting? Alleluia! 
Dying once, He all doth save, Alleluia! 
Where your victory, O grave? Alleluia! 

Love's redeeming work is done, Alleluia! 
Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia! 
Death in vain forbids Him rise, Alleluia! 
Christ hath opened paradise, Alleluia! 

Soar we now where Christ hath led, Alleluia! 
Following our exalted Head, Alleluia! 
Made like Him, like Him we rise, Alleluia! 
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!

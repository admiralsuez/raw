Sing a new song unto the Lord;
let your song be sung from mountains high.
Sing a new song unto the Lord, singing alleluia.

Yahweh's people dance for joy.
O come before the Lord,
and play for him on glad tambourines,
and let your trumpet sound.

Refrain

Rise, O children, from your sleep;
your Savior now has come.
He has turned your sorrow to joy
and filled your soul with song.

Refrain

Glad my soul for I have seen
the glory of the Lord.
The trumpet sounds; the dead shall be raised.
I know my Savior lives.

Refrain

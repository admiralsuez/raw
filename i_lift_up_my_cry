I lift up my cry
I lift up my cry!
To the hills
Around Jerusalem
To the God of all the earth
I lift up my eyes
I lift up my eyes
(Repeat chorus)

Who is our helper
The Lord of Heaven
He will deliver
God of all the earth
Who will preserve us
The mighty God will save
He will deliver
God of all the earth
(Repeat chorus and 1st verse)

Lift up your eyes
Lift up your eyes
He will deliver you
Lift up your eyes
(Repeat chorus and 1st verse) (Repeat chorus)


I lift up my eyes
I lift up my eyes
I lift up my eyes
I lift up my eyes
I lift up my eyes.

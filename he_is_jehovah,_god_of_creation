He is Jehovah, God of Creation
He is Jehovah, Lord God Almighty
The Balm of Gilead, the Rock of ages,
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee.

Sing Hallelujah, sing hallelujah,
 Sing Hallelujah, sing hallelujah,
He is Jehovah, the God Almighty,
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee

He is the 'Great I AM', the God of Abraham,
Jehovah Shalom, The God of peace I AM,
The God of Israel, The Everlasting one
He is Jehovah, the god that healeth thee.

He's our provider, Jehovah Jireh,
God of salvation, He's our Messiah
The Son He sent to you, and testified of Him,
He is Jehovah, the God that healeth thee.

I look at my life and I still can't believe it
How will I make it to where I stand now?
You don't understand, I was up against the whole world
And all I could feel was it breaking me down

But out of a hopeless situation
There came a song of redemption

Life may push my heart to the limit
But I won't let go of the joy in my soul
'Cause everything can change in a minute
And the world may try
But they're never gonna steal my joy

No, they're never, no, they're never

So get up, stand up and rise above it
If every plan that you made go so wrong
You don't have to give into the struggle
You may be down but don't stay there for long

In every hopeless situation
There is a song of redemption

Life may push my heart to the limit
But I won't let go of the joy in my soul
'Cause everything can change in a minute
And the world may try
But they're never gonna steal my joy

No, they're never, no, they're never

The world may say you're never gonna make it
The world may say you're not strong enough to take it
But I don't care 'cause of the joy of the Lord is real
And they're never gonna steal my joy, never, no, never

Life may push my heart to the limit
But I won't let go of the joy in my soul
'Cause everything can change in a minute
And the world may try
But they're never gonna steal my joy

Life may push my heart to the limit
But I won't let go of the joy in my soul
'Cause everything can change in a minute
And the world may try
But they're never gonna steal my joy

No, they're never, no, they're never
Never gonna steal my joy
No, they're never, no, no, they're never
Never gonna steal my joy

Raise up an army, O God,
Awake Your people 
Throughout the earth;
Raise up an army, O God,
To proclaim Your kingdom,
To declare Your Word,
To reveal Your glory, O God.

Our hope, our heart, our vision,
To see in every land
Your chosen people coming forth;
Fulfilling Your holy mission,
United as we stand,
Pledging our lives unto You, Lord.

Raise up an army, O God,
Awake Your people 
Through-out the earth;
Raise up an army, O God,
To proclaim Your kingdom,
To declare Your Word,
To reveal Your glory, O God.

O God, our glorious Maker,
We marvel at Your grace,
That You would use us in Your plan;
Rejoicing at Your favor,
Delighting in Your ways,
We'll gladly follow Your commands.

Raise up an army, O God,
Awake Your people 
Through-out the earth;
Raise up an army, O God,
To proclaim Your kingdom,
To declare Your Word,
To reveal Your glory, O God.

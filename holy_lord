Holy Lord,
Most Holy Lord,
You alone are worthy
Of my praise.

O Holy Lord,
Most Holy Lord,
With all of my heart
I sing:

Great are You Lord,
Worthy of praise;
Holy and true,
Great are You, Lord,
Most Holy Lord.

Holy Lord,
Most Holy Lord,
You alone are worthy
Of my praise.

O Holy Lord,
Most Holy Lord,
With all of my heart
I sing:

Great are You Lord,
Worthy of praise;
Holy and true,
Great are You, Lord,
Most Holy Lord.

Great are You Lord,
Worthy of praise; holy and true,
Great are You, Lord,
Most Holy Lord.
Lord, most holy Lord.

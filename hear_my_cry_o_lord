Hear my cry O Lord Attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth 
Will I cry out to Thee.

And when my heart is overwhelmed, 
Oh Lord, Lead me to the Rock
That is higher than I, That is higher than I.

For Thou hast been a shelter unto me,
A high tower, Lord, against the enemy.

That is higher than I, That is higher than I.

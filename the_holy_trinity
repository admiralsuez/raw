HOLY, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty ! 
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee ; 
Holy, holy, holy ! Merciful and Mighty ! 
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity ! 

Holy, holy, holy ! all the saints adore Thee, 

Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy 
sea, 

Cherubim and seraphim falling dowTi before Thee, 
Which wert, and art, and evermore shalt be. 

Holy, holy, holy ! though the- darkness hide Thee, 
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not 
see, 

Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee, 
Perfect in power, in love and purity.

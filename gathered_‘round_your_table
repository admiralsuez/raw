Gathered 'round Your table
On this holy eve,
Viewing Bethlehem's stable
We rejoice and grieve;

Joy to see You lying
In Your manger bed,
Weep to see You dying
In our sinful stead.

Prince of Glory, gracing
Heaven ere time began,
Now for us embracing
Death as Son of Man;

By Your birth so lowly,
By Your love so true,
By Your cross most holy,
Lord, we worship You!

Bethlehem's incarnation,
Calvary's bitter cross,
Wrought for us salvation
By Your pain and loss;

Now we fall before You
In this holy place,
Prostrate we adore You,
For Your gift of grace.

With profoundest wonder
We your body take
Laid in manger yonder,
Broken for our sake;

Hushed in adoration
We approach the cup
Bethlehem's pure oblation
Freely offered up.

Christmas Babe so tender,
Lamb who bore our blame,
How shall sinners render
Praises due Your name?

Do Your own good pleasure
In the lives we bring;
In Your ransomed treasure
Reign forever King!

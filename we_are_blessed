We are blessed
When we come together
We are blessed
When we come together
In the name of the Lord

Hosanna hosanna
Hosanna to the Lord 
Most High
Hosanna hosanna
Oh we have come together 
in the 
Name of the Lord

For He has promised us
When we gather in
His name
He will be near to us
When we lift our hearts
To Him in praise

God of our fathers,
Whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty
All the starry band

Of shining worlds
In splendor through the skies,
Our grateful songs
Before Thy throne arise.

Thy love divine
Hath led us in the past,
In this free land
By Thee our lot is cast;

Be Thou our Ruler,
Guardian, Guide and Stay,
Thy Word our law,
Thy paths our chosen way.

From war’s alarms,
From deadly pestilence,
Be Thy strong arm
Our ever-sure defense;

Thy true religion
In our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness
Nourish us in peace.

Refresh Thy people
On their toilsome way,
Lead us from night
To never-ending day;

Fill all our lives
With love and grace divine,
And glory, laud,
And praise be ever Thine!

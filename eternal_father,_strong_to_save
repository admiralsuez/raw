Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bids the mighty ocean deep,
Its own appointed limits keep:
O Hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.

O Christ, the Lord of hill and plain
O’er which our traffic runs amain
By mountain pass or valley low:
Whereever, Lord, our brethren go,
Protect them by Thy guarding hand
From every peril on the land.

O Spirit, whom the Father sent
To spread abroad the firmament:
O Wind of heaven, by Thy might
Save all who dare the eagle’s flight,
And keep them by Thy watchful care
From every peril in the air.

O Trinity of love and power,
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe’er they go,
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad praise from air and land and sea.

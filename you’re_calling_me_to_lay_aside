You’re calling me to lay aside, The worries of my day
To quiet down my busy mind, And find a hiding place.

Worthy, You are worthy,
I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours
I open my mouth and let a song of praise come forth
Worthy, You are Worthy

Of a child-like faith and 
Of my honest praise
And of my unashamed love

Of a holy life 
And of my sacrifice 
And of my unashamed love

You’re calling me to lay aside, The worries of my day
To quiet down my busy mind, And find a hiding place.


Worthy, You are worthy,
I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours
I open my mouth and let a song of praise come forth
Worthy, You are Worthy

Of a child-like faith and 
Of my honest praise
And of my unashamed love

Of a holy life 
And of my sacrifice 
And of my unashamed love

Worthy, You are Worthy,
Of a child-like faith and 
Of my honest praise
And of my unashamed love

Of a holy life 
And of my sacrifice 
And of my unashamed love

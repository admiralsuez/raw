Oh, how wonderful,  how wonderful it is just to be -
Knowing who we are, when we find Thee
Loving you, is so beautiful, stay with me, stay with me.
 
2.            Let me not forget, this pleasure You bring to my soul,
Help me not to seek,  other treasure that's fleeting and cold.
And all that is needed of me, to be so warm, and so free ---
(interlude) O how wonderful it is just to be... O how wonderful it is just to be.

 3.            I surrender now, to this time,  knowing I am yours, and God You are mine.
Loving You, will set me apart - From all fear, straight to your heart.
Let me not forget this pleasure You bring to my soul,
help me not to seek  other treasure that's fleeting and cold. 
And all that is needed of me, to be so warm and so free --
Is to ask You, oh yes, just to ask You,
For it is You who lives in me--      Who lives in me.

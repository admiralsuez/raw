One bread, one body,
one Lord of all.
One cup of blessings which we bless.
And we, though many,
throughout the earth,
we are one body in this one Lord.

Gentile or Jew,
servant or free,
woman or man
no more

Refrain

Many the gifts,
many the works,
one in the Lord
of all.

Refrain

Grain for the fields,
scattered and grown,
gathered to one
for all.

Refrain

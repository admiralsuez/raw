Taste and see, taste and see
the goodness of the Lord.

O taste and see, taste and see
the goodness of the Lord, of the Lord.


I will bless the Lord at all times.
Praise shall always be on my lips;
my soul shall glory in the Lord
for God has been so good to me.

Refrain

Glorify the Lord with me.
Together let us all praise God's name.
I called the Lord who answered me;
from all my troubles I was set free.

Refrain

Worship the Lord, all you people.
You'll want for nothing if you ask.
Taste and see that the Lord is good;
in God we need put all our trust.

Refrain

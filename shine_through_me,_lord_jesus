Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
In the darkness of a hurting world,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus.

Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
In the darkness of a hurting world,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus.

To the lost and battered lives
Adrift on stormy seas;
To the angry and confused
Crying to be free -

From the chains of bondage
That trap the soul in sin,
Let the light of Jesus
Shine from deep within.

Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus,
In the darkness of a hurting world,
Shine through me, Lord Jesus.

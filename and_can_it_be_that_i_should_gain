And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Savior's blood?
Died he for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?

Amazing love!
How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me?

Amazing love!
How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me?

He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace!
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race!

'Tis mercy all,
Immense and free,
For, O my God,
It found out me.

Amazing love!
How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me?

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night.
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray:
I woke - the dungeon flamed with light!

My chains fell off,
My heart was free,
I rose, went forth
And followed Thee.

Amazing love!
How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me?

No condemnation now I dread:
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,

Bold I approach
The eternal throne,
And claim the crown,
Through Christ my own.

Amazing love!
How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me?

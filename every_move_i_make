Every move I make 
I make in You;
You make me move Jesus.
Every breath I take 
I breathe in You!

Every step I take 
I take in You,
You are my way Jesus
Every breath I take
I breathe in You.

Waves of mercy
Waves of grace,
Everywhere I look,
I see your face!

Your love has Captured me,
Oh my God, this love, 
How can it be!

Every move I make
I make in You;
You make me move, Jesus!
Every breath I take 
I breathe in You!

Every step I take 
I take in You,
You are my way Jesus
Every breath I take
I breathe in You.

I wanna go deeper, 
But I don't know how to swim,
I wanna be meeker, 
But have you seen this old earth,
I wanna fly higher 
But these arms won't take me there,
I wanna be, I wanna be 


Maybe I could run, 
And maybe I could fly to you,
But do you feel the same, 
When all I see is blame in me?

And the wonder of it all, is that I'm Living just to fall more in love with You! 

And the wonder of it all is that I'm Living just to fall more in love with You!


I wanna go deeper, 
But it's just a stupid whim
I wanna be weaker, 
Being help to the strong,
I wanna run faster, 
But this leg won't carry me
I wanna be, I wanna be 


Maybe I could run, 
Maybe I could follow 
It's time to walk the path
Where many seem to fall 
Hold me in your arms 
Just like a father would 
How long do we have to wait? How long? 
We're going all the way.

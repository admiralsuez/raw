Rise up, O Church of God!
Have done with lesser things;
Give heart and mind and soul
and strength
To serve the King of kings.

Rise up, O Church of God!
His Kingdom tarries long;
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.

Rise up, O sons of God!
The Church for you doth wait,
Her strength unequal to her task,
Rise up and make her great!

Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod;
As followers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O Church of God!

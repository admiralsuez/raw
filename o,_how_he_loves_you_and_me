O, how He loves you and me,
O, how He loves you and me.
He gave His life, 
What more could He give?

Oh how He loves you,
Oh how He loves me,
Oh how He loves
You and me.

Jesus to Calvary did go,
His love for mankind to show;
What He did there
Brought hope from despair:

Oh how He loves you,
Oh how He loves me,
Oh how He loves
You and me.

I wonder as I wander,
Out under the sky,
How Jesus the Savior
Did come for to die.

For poor, orn’ry people
Like you and like I;
I wonder as I wander,
Out under the sky.

When Mary birthed Jesus,
‘Twas in a cow’s stall,
With wise men and farmers
And shepherds and all.

But high from God’s heaven
A star’s light did fall,
The promise of ages
It then did recall.

If Jesus had wanted 
For any wee thing,
A star in the sky 
Or a bird on the wing,

Or all of God’s angels 
In heav’n for to sing,
He surely could have had it,
‘Cause He was the King.

I wonder as I wander,
Out under the sky,
How Jesus the Savior
Did come for to die.

For poor, orn’ry people
Like you and like I;
I wonder as I wander,
Out under the sky.

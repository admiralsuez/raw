Ah, Lord God,
Thou hast made the heavens
And the earth
By Thy great power;

Ah, Lord God,
Thou hast made the heavens
And the earth 
By Thine outstretched arm.

Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
Nothing is too difficult for Thee.
Great and Mighty God,
Great in counsel 
And mighty in deed.

Nothing, nothing,
Absolutely nothing,
Nothing is too difficult
For Thee!

Absolutely nothing,
Nothing is too difficult

In the drying weary land
LORD You are the rain
In the sea of shattered ones
Your love comes rushing in
You hold the world within Your hands
And see each tear that falls
Through every fire and every storm
You're Always Enough
Always Enough

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak

Your love is the anthem of nations
rings out to the ages
And You're Always Enough for me

In the watches of the night
LORD You are my song
Hope is in the morning light
Your love shines like the dawn

You keep my heart in perfect peace
My life is in Your hands
When confusion hides my way
You're Always Enough
Always Enough

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak

Your love is the anthem of nations
rings out to the ages
And You're Always Enough for me

And rejoice for my for my Saviour reigns reigns
And rejoice for the lives
God on how set me free and
Worthy is the LORD

And rejoice for my Saviour reigns
And rejoice for the lives in me
God on how set me free and
Worthy is the LORD

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak

Your love is the anthem of nations
rings out to the ages
And You're Always Enough for me

Your love is peace to the broken
Faith for the widow
Hope for the orphan
Strength for the weak

Your love is the anthem of nations
rings out to the ages
And You're Always Enough

And rejoice for my Saviour reigns
And rejoice for the lives in me
God on how set me free and
Worthy is the LORD

In the drying weary land
LORD You are the rain

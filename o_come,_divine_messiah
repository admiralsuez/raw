O Come, Divine Messiah 

1. O come, divine Messiah! 
The world in silence waits the day 
When hope shall sing its triumph, 
And sadness flee away. 
 
Refrain: 
Dear Savior haste; 
Come, come to earth, 
Dispel the night and show Thy face, 
And bid us hail the dawn of grace. 
O come, divine Messiah! 
The world in silence waits the day 
When hope shall sing its triumph, 
And sadness flee away. 
 
2. O Christ, whom nations sigh for, 
Whom priest and prophet long foretold, 
Come break the captive fetters; 
Redeem the long-lost fold. 
 
Refrain 
 
3. You come in peace and meekness, 
And lowly will Thy cradle be; 
All clothed in human weakness 
We shall Thy Godhead see.

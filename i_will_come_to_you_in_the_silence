I will come to you in the silence,
I will lift you from all your fear.
You will hear my voice,
I claim you as my choice,
be still and know I am here.

I am hope for all who are hopeless,
I am eyes for all who long to see.
In the shadows of the night,
I will be your light,
come and rest in me.

I am strength for all the despairing,
healing for the ones
who dwell in shame.
All the blind will see,
the lame will all run free,
and all will know my name.

I am the Word that leads all to freedom,
I am the peace the world cannot give.
I will call your name, embracing
all your pain,
stand up, now walk, and live!

Chorus
Do not be afraid I am with you,
I have called you each by name.
Come and follow me,
I will bring you home;
I love you and you are mine.

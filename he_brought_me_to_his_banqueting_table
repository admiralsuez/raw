He brought me to his banqueting table,
And his banner... 
...Over me…
...Is Love!		 ...Is Love!

I am my beloved’s and He is mine,
I am my beloved’s and He is mine,
And his banner, 
Over me…
…Is love!	
...Is love!	

And we can feel the love
 of God in this place,
We believe in your mercy
And receive your grace.


We delight ourselves at
 Your table Oh God!
You do all things well,
Just look at our lives...

His banner over me, 
His banner over you,
His banner over us, 
Is love, love, love!

(repeat)

And we can feel the love
 of God in this place,
We believe in your mercy
And receive your grace.


We delight ourselves at
 Your table Oh God!
You do all things well,
Just look at our lives...

His banner over me, 
His banner over you,
His banner over us, 
Is love, love, love!

(repeat)

Our Lord God     
Thouhast made the heavens, 
And the earth by Thy great power
Our Lord God Thou hast made the heavens,     

And the earth by Thine outstretched arm,
Nothing is too difficult for Thee (2)
O great and  mighty God
Great in counsel and mighty in deed

Nothing nothing absolutely nothing
Nothing is too difficult for Thee

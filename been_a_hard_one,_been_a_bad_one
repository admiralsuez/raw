Been a hard one, Been a bad one
Been a tough one, Been a sad one
It's been one of those days that keeps chipping away at my heart
Nothing new here, It's what I do here
It's a stereotypical day, in the life
I'm surrounded by all of the pain and the strife
But I know it's alright, woah oh

[Chorus:]
Cause it's only the world I'm living in
It's only today I've been given
There ain't no way I'm giving in
Cause it's only the world (only the world)
I know the best is still yet to come
Cause even when my days in the world are done
There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me
Do do do do do do do do do, yeah it's only the world

Anybody can you hear me?
Do you feel me? I mean, do you feel me?
I know I'm not the only one wearing the weight in this world
We got problems (said it's alright)
Just remember (yeah, it's alright)
Take a good look around we're just stuck on the ground for a little while
Don't it make you smile

[Chorus:]
Cause it's only the world I'm living in (Yeah)
It's only today I've been given(Yeah)
There ain't no way I'm giving in
Cause it's only the world (only the world)
I know the best is still yet to come
Cause even when my days in the world are done
There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me
Do do do do do do do do do, yeah it's only the world

Do do do do do do do do do, yeah it's only the world

[Bridge:]
Heaven is a place where the tears on every face will be wiped away
And I can't wait to go, but for now it's enoughto know
This is only temporary this is only, Yeah, Alright!

[Chorus:]
Cause it's only the world I'm living in
It's only the day I've been given
There ain't no way I'm giving in
Cause it's only the world (only the world)
I know the best is still yet to come
Cause even when my days in the world are done
There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me

Cause it's only the world I'm living in
It's only tod I've been given
There ain't no way I'm giving in
Cause it's only the world (only the world)
I know the best is still yet to come
Cause even when my days in the world are done
There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me
(So much more than only the world, yeah)

Do do do do do do do do do, yeah it's only the world

Do do do do do do do do do, yeah it's only the world

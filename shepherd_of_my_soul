Shepherd of my soul
I give you full control 
Wherever you may lead
I will follow

I have made the choice
To listen to your voice
Wherever you may lead
I will go

Be it in a quiet pasture
Or by the gentle stream
The Shepherd of my soul
Is by my side


Should I face a mighty mountain
Or a valley dark and deep
The Shepherd of my soul
Will be my guide

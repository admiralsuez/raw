A pure heart, that's what I long for;
A heart that follows hard after Thee.
A pure heart, that's what I long for;
A heart that follows hard after Thee.

A heart that hides Your word
So that sin will not come in.
A heart that's undivided
But one You rule and reign;

A heart that beats compassion,
That pleases You, my Lord,
A sweet aroma of worship
That rises to Your throne.

A pure heart, that's what I long for;
A heart that follows hard after Thee.
A pure heart, that's what I long for;
A heart that follows hard after Thee.

A heart that hides Your word
So that sin will not come in.
A heart that's undivided
But one You rule and reign;

A heart that beats compassion,
That pleases You, my Lord,
A sweet aroma of worship
That rises to Your throne.

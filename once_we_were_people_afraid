Once we were people afraid,
lost in the night.
Then by your cross we we saved;
Dead became living, life from your giving.

Something which we have known,
something we've touched,
What we have seen with our eyes:
This we have heard, life-giving word.

He chose to give of himself,
became our bread.
Broken, that we might live.
Love beyond love,
Pain for our pain.

We are the presence of God;
this is our call.
now to become bread and wine:
Food for the hungry, life for the weary,
for to live with the Lord,
we must die with the Lord.

Chorus
We hold the death of the Lord
deep in our hearts.
Living; now we remain
with Jesus the Christ.

I danced in the morning when the world was begun
I danced in the moon, the stars and the sun
I danced down from Heaven and I danced on Earth
At Bethlehem I had my birth

Refrain
Dance, then, wherever you may be
I am the Lord of the Dance, said He
And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be
And I'll lead you all in the dance, said He

I danced for the scribe and the Pharisee
They would not dance; they would not follow me
So I danced for the fisherman, for James and John
They came with me and the dance went on

Refrain

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame
They holy people said it was a shame
So they whipped, they stripped, they hung me high
And they left me on the cross to die.

Refrain

I danced on a Friday, when the sky turned black
Its hard to dance with the Devil on your back
Oh they buried my body, they thought I'd gone
But I and the dance still go on.

Refrain

They cut me down, but I leap on high
I am the light that will never, never die
But I'll live in you if you'll live in Me
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he.

Refrain

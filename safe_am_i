Safe am I, Safe am I,
In the hollow of His hand.
Sheltered o'er, sheltered o'er
With His love forever more.

No ill can harm me,
No foe alarm me;
For He keeps both day and night.
Safe am I,  safe am I
In the hollow of His hand. 

Safe am I, Safe am I,
In the hollow of His hand.
Sheltered o'er, sheltered o'er
With His love forever more.

No ill can harm me,
No foe alarm me;
For He keeps both day and night.
Safe am I,  safe am I
In the hollow of His hand.

White as snow, white as snow,
Though my sins were as scarlet;
Lord, I know, Lord, I know,
That I'm clean and forgiven.

Through the power of Your blood,
Through the wonder of Your love,
Through faith in You 
I know that I can be white as snow.

White as snow, white as snow,
Though my sins were as scarlet;
Lord, I know, Lord, I know,
That I'm clean and forgiven.

Through the power of Your blood,
Through the wonder of Your love,
Through faith in You 
I know that I can be white as snow.

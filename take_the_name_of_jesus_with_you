Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you -
Take it, then where-e’er you go.

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations 'round you gather,
Breathe that holy Name in prayer.

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

O the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us
And His songs our tongues employ!

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings
In heaven we’ll crown Him
When our journey is complete.

Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

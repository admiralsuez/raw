With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

I will give my love to You,
The One who first loved me;
Through every moment of my life,
With every breath I breathe.

With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

All Your love and mercy,
You alone are worthy,
I will praise You, Lord
With all my heart.

I will sing my song to You,
You're the reason for each rhyme.
Your Spirit's captured all of me,
Strength, and soul, and mind.

With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

With all of my heart,
With all of my heart,
I will praise You, Lord.
I will praise You, Lord.
I will praise You, Lord
With all of my heart.

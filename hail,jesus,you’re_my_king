Hail,Jesus,You’re my King
Your  life frees me to sing
I will praise You
All  my days
You’re perfect in all your ways

Hail, Jesus, You’re my Lord
I will obey Your word
I want to see Your Kingdom come
Not my will
But Yours be done

Glory glory to the lamb
You ‘ll take me into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that Jesus reigns

Hail,hail Lion of Judah
How powerful You are
Hail,hail Lion of Judah
How wonderful You are

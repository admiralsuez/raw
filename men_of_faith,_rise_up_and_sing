Men of Faith, Rise Up and Sing
Of The Great and Glorious King
You Are Strong When You Feel Weak,
In Your Broken-Ness, Complete.

Shout To The North And The South.
Sing To The East And The West.
Jesus Is Saviour to All,
Lord of Heaven and Earth.

Rise Up Women of the Truth
Stand and Sing To Broken Hearts
Who Can Know the Healing Power?
Of Our Glorious King of Love?

We've been through Fire, We've Been through Rain.
We've Been Refined by the Pow'r of His Name
We've Fallen Deeper in Love with You.
You've burned the Truth on Our Lips.

Rise Up Church with Broken Wings;
Fill This Place with Songs Again
Of Our God Who Reigns On High.
By His Grace Again we'll fly.

Where You lead me
I will follow
With Your rod and staff to guide me
Over the mountains
Through the valleys
You will bring my heart through safely
And I will rest
In the shadow of Your wing
My soul follows hard after Thee

Oh my God
You are my keeper
And You have everything I need
You're my shepherd
My soul follows hard after Thee

The world's shaking 
With the love of God
Great and glorious 
Let the whole earth sing

And all You ever do
Is change the old for new 
People, we believe that...

God is bigger than
The air I breathe
The world we'll leave

God will save the day 
And all will say
“My Glorious!”

Clouds are breaking, 
Heaven's come to earth
Hearts awak'ning, 
Let the church bells ring

And all You ever do
Is change the old for new 
People, we believe that...

God is bigger than
The air I breathe
The world we'll leave

God will save the day 
And all will say
“My Glorious!”

My Glorious, 
My Glorious

God is bigger than
The air I breathe
The world we'll leave

God will save the day 
And all will say
“My Glorious!”

God is bigger than
The air I breathe
The world we'll leave

God will save the day 
And all will say
“My Glorious!”

My Glorious, 
My Glorious

Draw Me Close To You

Draw me close to you 
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say 
that I'm your friend

You are my desire.
No one else will do.
‘Cause nothing else 
Could take Your place,

To feel the warmth 
Of your embrace.
Help me find the way,
Bring me back to You!

You're all I want!
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want!
Help me know You are near!

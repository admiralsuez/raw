When the trumpet
Of the Lord shall sound
And time shall be no more
And the morning breaks eternal-
Bright and fair

When the saved of earth
Shall gather over
On the other shore
And the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory
Of His resurrection share-

When His chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies
And the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

Let us labor for the Master
From the dawn 奏il setting sun,
Let us talk of
All His wondrous love and care;

Then when all of life is over
And our work on earth is done
And the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I値l be there!

Nobody else could have changed my heart
Nobody else could
have saved me
Picked up the pieces when I fell apart
And I am so glad you have  unchained me

You are the One
that I love Light of the world Sent from above
Sing Hallelujah
Shout to the Lord
You are the One - 4
I love

If I knew the song that the angels sing
We'd be singing together
'Cause I can't wait for eternity praising your name forever

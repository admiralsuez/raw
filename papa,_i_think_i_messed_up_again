Papa, I think I messed up again
Was it something I did, 
Was it something I said
I don't mean to do you wrong
It's just the way of human nature

Sister, I know I let you down
I can tell by the fact you're Never coming 'round
You don't have to say a thing
I can tell by your eyes
Exactly what you mean

Well it's time to get down
On my knees and pray
Lord, undo me
Put away my flesh and bone
'Till You own
The spirit through me
Lord, undo me

Mama, I know I made you cry
But I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to lie
While the world shook
Its head in shame
I let you take the blame

Brother, I know you labored
So hard to please me
But I cut you down
And I left you on your knees
I know it must be, yeah

Time to get down 
On my knees and pray
Lord undo me
Put away my flesh and bone
'Till You own
The spirit through me

Lord, I 
Am wanting...needing...
Guilty and greedy...
Unrighteous...unholy...
Undo me, undo me

Abba, Father, 
You must wonder Why
More times than Peter 
I have denied
Three nails and a cross to prove
I owe my life eternally to You

And it's time to get 
Down on my knees and pray
Lord, undo me
Put away my flesh and bone
'Till You own 
The spirit through me
Lord, undo me

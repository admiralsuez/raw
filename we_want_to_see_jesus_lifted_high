We want to see Jesus lifted high,

A banner that flies across this land.

That all men might see the truth and know

That He is the way to heaven.

We want to see (clap x 3)

We want to see (clap x 3)

We want to see Jesus lifted high.

(repeat)


Step by step we're moving forward,

Little by little we're taking ground,

Every prayer is a powerful weapon,

Strongholds all come tumbling down and down And down and down



We want to see (clap x 3)

We want to see (clap x 3)

We want to see Jesus lifted high.

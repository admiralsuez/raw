Another cold night
Another late flight
It's almost show time, and Diverse City's waitin' on me
We got a packed house, the crowd is callin' out
They want the beat to drop, but what we really need is You

[Chorus:]
If You wanna steal my show, I'll sit back and watch You go
If You got somethin' to say, go on and take it away
Need You to steal my show, can't wait to watch You go
So take it away

So now the crowd is hype, that you showed up tonight
Anticipatin', cravin' somethin' more than smoke and lights
So I'll step out the way, I'll give You center stage
Alight
Spotlight
Give 'em what they came for ...

[Chorus]

When You arrive, we come to life
Our hearts collide, they're beating in the same time
You're comin' through, all eyes on You
Our hearts collide, they're beating in the same time, beating in the same time

No matter who we are, no matter what we do
Every day we can choose to say ...

[Chorus]

My life
My friends
My heart
It's all Yours, God
Take it away
My dreams
My fears
My family
My career
Take it away
Take it away
It's all Yours, God
Take it away
Take it away
It's You I wanna live for

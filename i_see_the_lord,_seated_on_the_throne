I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalt-ed
And the train of His robe fills the temple with glo-ry

And the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled 
with His glo-ry

Holy, holy, holy,
Holy is the Lord!

(repeat)

Worthy, Worthy, Worthy,
Worthy is the Lord!

(repeat)

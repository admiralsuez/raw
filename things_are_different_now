Things are different now,
Something happened to me
When I gave my heart to Jesus.

Things are different now,
I was changed, it must be
When I gave my heart to Him.

Things I loved before
Have passed away,
Things I love far more
Have come to stay;

Things are different now,
Something happened that day
When I gave my heart to Him.

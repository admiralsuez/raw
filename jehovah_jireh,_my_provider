Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me, for me, for me
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider
His grace is sufficient for me

My God shall supply all my needs
According to His riches in glory
He will give His angels charge over me
Jehovah Jireh cares for me, for me, for me
Jehovah Jireh cares for me

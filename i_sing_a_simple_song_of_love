I sing a simple song of love,
To my Savior, to my Jesus.
I’m grateful for the things you’ve done,
My loving Savior, oh precious Jesus!
My heart is glad that You called me your 	own.
There’s no place I’d rather be…

Than in your arms of love,
In your arms of love,
Holding me still, holding me near,
In Your arms of love.

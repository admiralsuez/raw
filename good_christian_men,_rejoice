Good Christian men, rejoice
With heart and soul and voice;
Give ye heed to what we say:
News! News!
Jesus Christ is born today.

Good Christian Men, Rejoice

Ox and ass before Him bow,
And He is in the manger now:
Christ is born today!
Christ is born today!  

Good Christian men, rejoice
With heart and soul and voice;
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Joy! Joy!
Jesus Christ was born for this!

He has opened heaven’s door,
And man is blessed evermore:
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!

Good Christian men, rejoice
With heart and soul and voice;
Now ye need not fear the grave:
Peace! Peace!
Jesus Christ was born to save!

Calls you one and calls you all
To gain His everlasting hall:
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!

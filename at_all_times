At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times [x2]

Strong and courageous
Mighty in battle
He's fighting for us
The victory is ours

Put on your armor
The sword of the spirit
Our weapon is worship
The victory is ours
Shout out to Jesus

At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times [x2]

Praise Him in the valley
Praise Him on the mountain
Praise Him in the heavens
The victory is ours

Worship while you're weeping
Worship while you're waiting
Worship while you're winning
The victory is ours
Shout out to Jesus
Shout out to Jesus

At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times [x4]

At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times...

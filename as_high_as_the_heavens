As high as the heavens 
Are above the earth,
So great is the Father's love;

As far as the east
Is from the west,
So far has He taken
Our sin from us.

For His anger lasts only a moment,
But His favor lasts for a lifetime;
Weeping may remain for a night
But rejoicing comes, 
It comes in the morning.

But His favor lasts for a lifetime;

But rejoicing comes,

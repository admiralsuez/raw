1.   As night gives birth to the dawn and I see all the grandeur of each day.
I long to have and to hold, all the wonder of your heart,
All the power in your love. All the mystery embodied in your word.
  (Chorus)               Spirit breathe your breath of love!
                                Creation yearns for you to come.
                                Renew your earth, outpour your healing care.
                                Lord restore the harmony where humankind may learn to see,
                                The hope the dream in your almighty plan.
 
2.  The earth is blessed and adorned
By the breath and presence of your love.
All those who dwell in this land - shall awaken to your voice
They shall stand to give you praise, and your faithfulness will reign for evermore.
(repeat Chorus)

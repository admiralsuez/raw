Suggestions, questions
People want to know
Is there life after talk
Cause there's talk on the row
Twistin' words that I've never even said
To the ones that I trust
Or my "Boo" in our bed
Will he make it, I bet he won't
As they're runnin' through the minutes
On their cell phones
So the picture's painted
You got the point
And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint 

Sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight 

[CHORUS]
I always feel like somebody's watchin' me
Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back
See I'm down with the King
So I got it like that 

It's no joke, I've been roped in
Chokin' on a bone
From a fish in the school of your twilight zone
You shook me, took me to another place
Where the air I'm breathin's like mace in my face
If this controversy is your way
You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny
'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a son of the Light
Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight 

Sometimes I feel Grace in the middle of the night
In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight 

And sometimes I feel God in the midst of a show
As the palm trees sway in an afterglow 

[CHORUS]

One Phenomenon, one phenomenon
And it just can't be stopped ya'll 

We rock forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live forever
It's a phenomenon that can't be stopped
Forever, we stop whenever
We rock forever, we stop whenever
We die whenever, we live together
It's a phenomenon that can't be stopped now 

Everybody out of the way
It's monumental at the end of the day
So come what may
But it's a wonder that will never fade
A marvel that will tickle the mind
It's unaccountable in actual time
But when we're free
They will see what we were destined to be 

Well I'm alive and I'm enjoyin' the ride
But livin' for the moment I die
Cause when I'm done, we will run eternally as one
My soul is up, up and away
My body dead right where it lays
I'm movin' on going gone into the new beyond 

This is the drama you've been waiting for
A new dimension that is yours to explore
Such mystery is looming at your door
This is the moment I've been praying for

Come! Live in the light!
Shine with the joy
and the love of the Lord!
We are called to be
light for the kingdom,
to live in the freedom
of the city of God!

Come! Open your heart!
Show your mercy to
all those in fear!
We are called to be
hope for the hopeless
so hatred and blindness
will be no more!

Sing! Sing a new song!
Sing of that great day when
all will be one!
God will reign, and we'll
walk with other as
sister and brother,
united in love!

Chorus
We are called to act with justice,
we are called to love tenderly,
we are called to serve one another;
to walk humbly with God!

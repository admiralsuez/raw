What a fellowship,
What a joy divine.
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

What a blessedness,
What a peace is mine,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

O how sweet to walk
In this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms;

O, how bright the path
Grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have I to dread, 
What have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms?

I have blessed peace
With my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

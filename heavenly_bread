Heavenly bread 
That becomes the bread for all mankind;
Bread from the angelic host 
That is the end of all imaginings.
O, miraculous thing!
This Body of God will nourish 
Even the poorest, 
The most humble of servants. 
Even the poorest, 
The most humble of servants. 

O God, one substance in Three Persons, 
we beseech Thee, 
come to visit us, 
as we adore Thee: 
guide us on Thy paths 
whither we direct our course, 
to the light 
wherein Thou dost dwell.
to the light 
wherein Thou dost dwell.

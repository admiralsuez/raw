All creation cries to you
Worshipping in Spirit and in truth
Glory to the faithful one
Jesus Christ God's son

All Creation gives you praise
You alone are truly great
You alone are God who reigns
For eternity

God is great and his praise fills the earth
Fills the heavens and
Your name will be praise
Through all the world
God is great sing his praise all the earth
All the heavens 'cause were living for  
The Glory of your name 
The Glory of your name

All to you Oh God we bring
Jesus teach us how to live
Let your fire burn in us 
That all may hear and all may see

Holy is the Lord The whole earth sings
The whole earth sings (4)

Jesus, I've forgotten the words 
That You have spoken
Promises that burned within 
My heart have now grown dim
With a doubting heart 
I follow the paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbelief
Renew the fire again

Lord have mercy
Christ have mercy 
Lord have mercy on me

I have built an altar 
Where I worship things of men
I have taken journeys 
That have drawn me far from You
Now I am returning to 
Your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions
Help me love You again

I have longed to know You 
And Your tender mercies
Like a river of forgiveness 
Ever flowing without end
I bow my heart before You
In the goodness of Your presence
Your grace forever shining
Like a beacon in the night

I will listen for Your voice
to hear You call on me
The way I know You want me to
I will try to find Your heart 
down here on my knees
I need to see things the way You do

I Will

I will walk the darkest valley
I will leave the world behind me
I will give all that's inside me, I will
I will lay down all my pride
I will strain to see the light
I will try to do what's right,
I will, I will

I will keep Your promises right here in my heart
There Your words will always stay
I will hold You through the good because You've held me through the bad
You were always there to rescue me

I will walk the darkest valley
I will leave the world behind me
I will give all that's inside me, I will
I will lay down all my pride
I will strain to see the light
I will try to do what's right,
I will, I will

Faith is the hardest part
‘Cause doing's just the start
He will light your way
He just needs You to say

I will walk the darkest valley
I will leave the world behind me
I will give all that's inside me, I will
I will lay down all my pride
I will strain to see the light
I will try to do what's right,
I will, I will

I will walk the darkest valley
I will leave the world behind me
I will give all that's inside me, I will
I will lay down all my pride
I will strain to see the light
I will try to do what's right,
I will, I will

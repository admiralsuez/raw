Away in a manger
No crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet  head;

The stars in the sky
Looked down where He lay, 
The little Lord Jesus,
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, 
The Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus 
No crying He makes,

I love Thee, Lord Jesus
Look down from the sky, 
And stay by my cradle 
‘Til morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus, 
I ask Thee to stay
 Close by me forever,
And love me, I pray.

Bless all the dear children
In thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven,
To live with Thee there.

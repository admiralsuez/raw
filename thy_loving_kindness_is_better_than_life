Thy loving kindness is better than life.
Thy loving kindness is better than life.
My lips shall praise Thee,
Thus will I bless Thee:
I will lift up my hands unto Thy name.

I lift my hands, Lord, unto Thy name.
I lift my hands, Lord, unto Thy name.
My lips shall praise Thee,
Thus will I bless Thee:
I will lift up my hands unto Thy name.

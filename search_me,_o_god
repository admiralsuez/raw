Search me, O God,
And know my heart today;
Try me, O Savior, 
Know my thoughts, I pray.

See if there be
Some wicked way in me;
Cleanse me from sin,
And set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord,
For cleansing me from sin;
Fulfill Thy Word,
And make me pure within.

Fill me with fire,
Where I once burned with shame;
Grant my desire
To magnify Thy name.

Lord, take my life,
And make it wholly Thine;
Fill my poor heart
With Thy great love divine.

Take all my will,
My passion, self and pride;
I now surrender,
Lord - In me abide.

O, Holy Ghost,
Revival comes from Thee;
Send a revival,
Start the work in me.

Thy Word declares
Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessings now,
O Lord, I humbly plead.

Oh my Lord

I remember feeling like I'm all alone
Couldn't ever give anybody else control
Heavy burdens always seemed to weigh me down
I called out, "Save me now"

There You were to catch me when I couldn't stand
'Cause I was falling, falling with no way to land
I'm amazed by Your everlasting love
Your strength lifted me up

(Oh my Lord)
You're gonna set me free
(Oh my Lord)
Ain't nothing holding on me

(Oh my Lord)
It's a brand new day
Somebody raise your hands and say
Oh, oh my Lord

Since I met you, I have been forever changed
Let the world around know I don't have to be afraid
You know I'll praise You, every season of my life
My Jesus, I'll testify

(Oh my Lord)
You're gonna set me free
(Oh my Lord)
Ain't nothing holding on me

(Oh my Lord)
It's a brand new day
Somebody raise your hands and say
Oh my Lord

(Oh my Lord)
Oh, oh my Lord
(Oh my Lord)
Oh, oh my Lord
(Oh my Lord)
Oh, oh my Lord
(Oh my Lord)

Saved me, forgave me
And now I believe
I belong to the King of kings

Saved me, forgave me
And now I believe
I belong to the King of kings

Saved me, forgave me
And now I believe
I belong to the King of kings

Saved me, forgave me
And now I believe
I belong to the King of kings

(Oh my Lord)
You're gonna set me free
(Oh my Lord)
Ain't nothing holding on me

(Oh my Lord)
It's a brand new day
Somebody raise your hands and say
Oh my Lord

Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord

Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
(Oh my Lord)
It's a brand new day
Somebody raise your hands and say
Oh my Lord

Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord
Oh my Lord

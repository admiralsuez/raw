Have you ever heard a love song
That set your spirit free?
Have you ever watched a sunrise
And felt you could not breathe?
What if it's Him? What if it's God speaking?

Have you ever cried a tear
That you could not explain?
Have you ever met a stranger
Who already knew your name?
What if it's Him? What if it's God speaking?

Who knows how He'll get a hold of us?
Get our attention to prove He's enough
He'll do and He'll use whatever he wants to
To tell us 'I love you'

Have you ever lost a loved one
Who you thought should still be here?
Do you know what it feels like
To be tangled up in fear?
What if He's somehow involved?
What if He's speaking through it all?

Who knows how He'll get a hold of us?
Get our attention to prove He's enough?
He'll do and He'll use whatever he wants to
To tell us 'I love you'

His ways are higher, His ways are best
Though sometimes strange
What could be stranger than God in a manger?

Who knows how He'll get a hold of us?
Get our attention to prove He's enough?
Who knows how He'll get a hold of you?
Get your attention to prove He's enough?
He'll do and He'll use whatever He wants to
To tell us 'I love you'

God is speaking, 'I love you'

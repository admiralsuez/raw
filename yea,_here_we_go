Yea, here we go
1, 2, 3

She was 17 when she came on the scene
I saw her down the hall and thought that I was in a dream
See she was from the islands
Which had this brother smiling
Little did I know that I'd be on this, mic testifying

I like sunsets but she likes sunrise
I'm always running late and she's always on time
But I like U2 and she like Coldplay
But something tells me we're gonna be OK

'Cause she was made for me
You gave 'er to me
I said I'd hold on loosely but I so wanna squeeze you
Just right for me and for the life of me
I can't believe I get to call her mine

Yeah she was made for me
Made for me
Yeah she was made for me
Made for me

Next chapter, we got hitched
And thought we'd have some kids
Looked up and now we got five little Jamaricans

I thank God every day
I'm blessed in a crazy way
My God said to the end
This thing we got is cool like shake

I like sunsets but she likes sunrise
I'm always running late and she's always on time
Well I like hip-hop and she likes raggae
So we meet in the middle with some Shattie

'Cause she was made for me
You gave 'er to me
I said I'd hold on loosely but I so wanna squeeze you
Just right for me and for the life of me
I can't believe I get to call her mine

Yeah she was made for me
Made for me
Yeah she was made for me
Made for me

She is a flower, You are the rain
She gets more beautiful with every passing day
She is my flower and You are the sun
She gets more beautiful because of how You love
How You love

I get to call her mine
I get to call her mine, oh my

See she like slow dates and I like fast dates
She into books, I'm into movies
She made straight As
Well I got white skin and she got brown skin
But milk and coffee's always been a beautiful blend

She was made for me
When You gave 'er to me
I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you
Just right for me and for the life of me
I can't believe I get to call her mine

She was made for me
When You gave 'er to me
I said I'd hold on loose but I so wanna squeeze you
Just right for me and for the life of me
I can't believe I get to call her mine

And she was made for me
She was made, she was made
Made for me
And she was made for me
She was made, she was made
Made for me

She was made, she was made for me (I get to call her mine)
She was made, she was made for me (I get to call her mine, oh my)

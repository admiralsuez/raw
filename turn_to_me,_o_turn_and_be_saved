Turn to me, O turn and be saved, says the Lord, for I am God, 
there is no other, none beside me, I call your name. 

Verse 1 

I am he that comforts you, who are you to be afraid. 
Of flesh that fades, is made like the grass of the field soon to wither. 

Refrain 

Verse 2 

Listen to me, my people; Give ear to me, my nation: 
A law will go forth from me, and my justice for a light to the people. 

Refrain 

Verse 3 

Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look at the earth down below. 
The heavens will vanish like smoke, and the earth will wear out like a garment. 

Refrain

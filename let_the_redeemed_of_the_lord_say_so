Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so;
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
"I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed, 
Praise the Lord!"

Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so;
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
"I'm redeemed, I'm redeemed, 
Praise the Lord!"

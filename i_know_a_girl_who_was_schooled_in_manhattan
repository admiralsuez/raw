I know a girl who was schooled in Manhattan. 

She reads dusty books and learns phrases in Latin.

She is an author  or maybe a poet,   

A genius but its just this world doesn't know it.

She works on 'er novel most every day,  
If you laugh she will say...

Seize the day,  Seize whatever you can!  

Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand.
Seize the day, pray for grace from God's hand,  
That nothin' will stand in your way...  Seize the day.

Well I know a doctor, A fine young physician. 
  
Left his six figure job for a mission  position.

He's healin' the sick  in an African clinic.  

He works in the dirt and writes home to the cynics.

He says we work through the night almost ev-er-y day,  

As we watch the sun rise we can say...

Seize the day,  Seize whatever you can!  

Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand.
Seize the day, pray for grace from God's hand,  
That nothin' will stand in your way...  Seize the day.

Well I know a man  who's been doin' some thinkin'.
 
He's as bitter and cold as the whisky he's drinkin'.

He's talkin' bout fear  'bout chances not traken.  

If you listen to him you can hear his heart  breakin'.

He says "One day youra boy  The next day you're dead...  

I wish way back when someone had said..."

Seize the day,  Seize whatever you can!  

Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand.
Seize the day, pray for grace from God's hand,  
That nothin' will stand in your way...  Seize the day.

 Lai de Dai Dai    Lai de Dai Dai    Lai de Dai Dai-e-i

Well one thing I've noticed  wherever I wander.  

Everyone's got a dream  he can follow or squander.

You can do what you will with the days you are given.  

I'm tryin' to spend mine on the business of  livin',

So I'm singin' my songs off of any old stage.  

You can laugh if you want HA(I)'ll still say...


Seize the day,  Seize whatever you can!  

Cause life slips away just like hourglass sand.
Seize the day, pray for grace from God's hand,  
That nothin' will stand in your way...  Seize the day.

Enter in, enter in, I am free to enter in.
In His name, in His blood, in His Spirit I come freely.
To the throne of grace and worship face to face.
Oh praise the living God, I am free, I am free to enter in.
Enter in, we are free to enter in.
In His name, in His blood, in His Spirit I come freely.
To the throne of grace and worship face to face.
Oh praise the living God, we are free, we are free to enter in."Enter In"

All of You is more than enough for
All of me for every thirst
and every need
You satisfy me
With Your love and
all I have in You
Is more than enough

More than all I want
More than all I need
You are more than enough for me
More than all I know
More than all I can see
You are more than enough

You are my supply
My bread of life
Still more awesome than I know
You are my reward worth living for
Still more awesome than I know

As the deer 
panteth for the water
So my soul 
longeth after You
You alone are 
my heart’s desire
And I long to worship you

You alone are 
my strength my shield
To you alone 
may my spirit yield
You alone are 
my heart’s desire
And I long to worship you

You’re my friend and
You are my brother
Even though you are the King
I love you more than any other
So much more than anything

I want you more 
than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye

O thou joyful,
O thou wonderful,
Grace-revealing Christmastide!

Jesus came to win us,
From all sin within us,
Glorify the holy Child!

O thou joyful, O thou wonderful
Love-revealing Christmastide!
Loud hosannas singing
And all praises bringing:
May Thy love with us abide!

O thou joyful, O thou wonderful
Peace-revealing Christmastide!
Darkness disappeareth,
God's own light now neareth:
Peace and joy to all betide!

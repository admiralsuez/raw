Lord, You are
More precious than silver;
Lord, You are
More costly than gold.

Lord, You are
More beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire
Compares with You.

Lord, You are
More precious than silver;
Lord, You are
More costly than gold.

Lord, You are
More beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire
Compares with You.

Nothing I desire,
Nothing I desire
Compares with You.

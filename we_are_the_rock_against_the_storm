We are the rock against the storm of the changes
We are the rock, against the flood of the tide
The one true voice that speaks throughout the ages
We are the church of Jesus Christ.

"Who do men say that I am?"
Asked the Lord to his disciples.
"And who do you say that I am?"
That he asks each one of us.

"You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God"
That was the answer of Simon Peter.
And the Lord said, "You are the Rock on which I'll build my
Church, and the gates of hell won't prevail against it."

We know the truth and we must never forget
That this time will also come to pass.
So be strong and very courageous
Share your love it's the only thing that will last.

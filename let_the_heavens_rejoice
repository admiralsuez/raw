Let the heavens rejoice
And the earth be glad,
Let the seas resound
With a mighty roar.

Let the trees of the forest 
Clap their hands,
Let the earth be filled 
With the glory of the Lord.

All of creation is boldly proclaiming
The wonderful things He has done;
Let's join with all nations 
In one declaration,
Proclaiming the goodness of God!

Let the heavens rejoice
And the earth be glad,
Let the seas resound
With a mighty roar.

Let the trees of the forest 
Clap their hands,
Let the earth be filled 
With the glory of the Lord.

The heavens above are declaring
His splendor,
His power can not be denied;
For all of creation is
Loudly confessing 
That Jesus, our Lord, is alive!

Let the heavens rejoice
And the earth be glad,
Let the seas resound
With a mighty roar.

Let the trees of the forest 
Clap their hands,
Let the earth be filled 
With the glory of the Lord.

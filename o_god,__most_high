O God,  Most High,  
Almighty King,
The Champion of heaven, 
Lord of everything.

You fought, You won, 
 Death lost its sting.
And standing in Your victory
 We sing!

You have broken the chains
That held our captive souls,
You have broken the chains
And used them on Your foes.

All Your enemies are bound,
They tremble at the sound
Of Your Name.
Jesus, You have broken
The chains.

The power of hell
Has been undone,
Captivity held captive 
By the Risen One;

And in the Name
Of God's great Son,
We thank You 
For the victory You've won!

You have broken the chains
That held our captive souls,
You have broken the chains
And used them on Your foes.

All Your enemies are bound,
They tremble at the sound
Of Your Name.
Jesus, You have broken
The chains.

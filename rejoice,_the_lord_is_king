Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore!
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing
And triumph evermore:

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice,
Again I say, rejoice!

The Lord, our Savior, reigns,
The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains
He took His seat above:

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice,
Again I say, rejoice!

His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heaven;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus given:

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice,
Again I say, rejoice!

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Our Lord, the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:

Lift up your heart,
Lift up your voice!
Rejoice,
Again I say, rejoice!

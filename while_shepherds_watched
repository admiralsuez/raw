While shepherds watched
Their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,

While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks

The angel of the Lord
Came down
And glory shone around,
And glory shone around.

“Fear not!” said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind,
“Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind,
To you and all mankind.”

“To you, in David's town this day,
Is born of David's line,
The Savior who is Christ the Lord,
And this shall be the sign,
And this shall be the sign:”

“The heavenly Babe you there shall find,
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid;
And in a manger laid.”

“All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace:
Goodwill henceforth from heaven to men,
Begin and never cease,
Begin and never cease.”

He is able, more than able
To accomplish what concerns me today.
He is able, more than able
To handle anything that comes my way.

He is able, more than able
To do much more
Than I could ever dream,
He is able, more than able
To make me what He wants me to be.

He is able, more than able

He is able, more than able

Than I could ever dream,
He is able, more than able
To make me what He wants me to be.

He is able, more than able
To do much more
Than I could ever dream,
He is able, more than able
To make me what He wants me to be,

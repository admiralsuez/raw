I can see that you love Jesus first 
It's plain to me And that you sit close 
And hear His heart beat
For in your eyes I see shining love
That speaks to clear
And I can hear them saying so sweetly

He is lovely, he is holy 
Gave supremely, that all might see 
He is gentle, tender hearted 
Risen Saviour, he is God 

Master, Maker, Life Creator 
Come and dwell in me 
That my heart may know your tender mercy 
Shine through me that all may see 
Your love so full and free 
And I'll declare your praise 
Through endless ages

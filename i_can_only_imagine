I can only imagine 
What it will be like 
When I walk 
By your side 
I can only imagine 
What my eyes will see 
When your face 
Is before me 
I can only imagine

Surrounded by Your glory, 
What will my heart feel 
Will I dance for you Jesus 
Or in honor of you be still 
Will I stand in your presence 
Or to my knees will I fall 
Will I sing hallelujah, 
Will I be able to speak at all 
I can only imagine (2)

When that day comes 
When I find myself 
Standing in the Son 
I can only imagine 
When all I will do 
Is forever 
Forever worship You 
I can only imagine

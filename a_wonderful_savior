A wonderful Savior
Is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;

He Hideth My Soul

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
Where rivers of pleasure
I see.

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Savior
Is Jesus my Lord!
He taketh my burden away;

He holdeth me up
And I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength
As my day.

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His fullness divine,

I sing in my rapture,
“O glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!”

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise,
To meet Him in clouds
Of the sky,

His perfect salvation,
His wonderful love,
I’ll shout with the millions
On high.

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;

He hideth my life
In the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.

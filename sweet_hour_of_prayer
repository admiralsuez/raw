Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer,
That calls me from a world of care,

And bids me at
My Father's throne
Make all my wants
And wishes known:

In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer,
Sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear

To Him whose truth
And faithfulness
Engage the waiting
Soul to bless:

And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word, and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

I have found a Friend
Who is all to me,
His love is ever true;

I love to tell
How He lifted me,
And what His grace
Can do for you.

Saved by His power divine,
Saved to new life sublime!
Life is now sweet
And my joy is complete,
For I'm saved, saved, saved!

He saves me from
Every sin and harm,
Secures my soul each day.

I'm leaning strong
On His mighty arm;
I know He'll guide me
All the way.

Saved by His power divine,
Saved to new life sublime!
Life is now sweet
And my joy is complete,
For I'm saved, saved, saved!

When poor and needy
And all alone,
In love He said to me,

Come unto Me
And I'll lead you home,
To live with Me
Eternally.ÅE

Saved by His power divine,
Saved to new life sublime!
Life is now sweet
And my joy is complete,
For I'm saved, saved, saved!

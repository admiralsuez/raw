1. O Mary Mother, sweetest best; from heaven's immortal bowers. 
     Do gather for a little child, a bouquet of sweet flowers. 
     I  wish my little heart to be a cradle fair and gay, where blessed Jesus may repose 
     On my First Communion Day.  
     Where blessed Jesus may repose on my First Communion Day.

2.  My little child, I can obtain so bright a wreath for thee. 
     That Jesus will delight to come, within thy heart to be.  
     I'll give thee lovely charity more warm than roses glow. 
    I'll give thee heavenly purity more white than lilly snow 
    I'll give thee heavenly purity more white than lilly snow.

3.  The violet of humility shall yield a sweet perfume 
      And Jesus will delight to be, within thy little room. 
      But then remember dearest child, the blossoms that I give
     require the watering of a prayer or they will cease to live 
     require the watering of a prayer or they will cease to live.

Joy to the World! the Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing  (2)
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the eath! the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy (2)
Repeat Repeat the sounding joy

No more let sins and sorrows grow
No thorns infest the ground
He comes to make his blessings flow
Far as the curse is found (2)
Far as Far as the curse is found

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousness
And wonders of His love (2)
And wonders and wonders of his love

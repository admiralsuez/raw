The trumpets sound, the angels sing
The feast is ready to begin
The gates of heav'n are open wide
And Jesus welcomes you inside

Sing with thankfulness
Songs of pur delight
Come and revel in heaven's love and light
Take your place at the table of the King
The feast is ready to begin
The feast is ready to begin

Tables are laden with good things
O taste the peace and joy He brings
He'll fill you up with love dvine
He'll turn your water into wine

Jesus, Jesus, we thank You, we thank You
For Your love, for Your love
For Your joy, for Your joy
Jesus, Jesus, we thank You, we thank You
For the good things, for the good things
You give to us, You give to us

The hungry heart He satisfies
Offers the poor His paradise
Now hear all heav'n and earth applaud
The amazing goodness of the Lord

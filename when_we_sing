When we sing,
Hear our songs to You
When we dance, 
Feel us move to You

When we laugh, 
Fill our smiles with You
When we lift 
Our voices louder still,
Can you hear us?
Can you feel?

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

When we sing, LOUD!
Hear our songs to You,
When we dance, round,
Feel us move to You

When we laugh aloud,
Fill our smiles, with You

When we lift 
Our voices louder still, 
Can You hear us?
Can you feel?

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

And our love is big, 
Our love is loud, 
Fill this place 
With this love now (4x)

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

Let’s lift our voices 
Louder still, 
Our God is near, 
Our God is here.(4x)

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

We love You, Lord,
We love You,
We love You,(2x)

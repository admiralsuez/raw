Rejoice, ye pure in heart,
Rejoice, give thanks and sing.
Your festal banner wave on high,
The cross of Christ your King.

Rejoice,
Rejoice,
Rejoice, give thanks,
And sing!

With all the angel choirs,
With all the saints on earth,
Pour out the strains
Of joy and bliss,
True rapture, noblest mirth!

Rejoice,
Rejoice,
Rejoice, give thanks,
And sing!

Yes, on through life's long path,
Still chanting as we go;
From youth to age,
By night and day,
In gladness and in woe.

Rejoice,
Rejoice,
Rejoice, give thanks,
And sing!

Still lift your standard high,
Still march in firm array;
As warriors
Through the darkness toil
'Til dawns the golden day.

Rejoice,
Rejoice,
Rejoice, give thanks,
And sing!

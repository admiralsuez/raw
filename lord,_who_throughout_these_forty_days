Lord, who throughout these forty days, for us did fast and pray,
Teach us to overcome our sins and close by you to stay.

As you with Satan did content, and did the victory win,
O give us strength in you to fight, in you to conquer sin.

As you did hunger and did thirst, so teach us, gracious Lord,
To die to self, and so to live by your most holy word.

And through these days of penitence, and through your Passion tide,
For evermore, in life and death, O Lord! with us abide.

Abide with us, that through this life of doubts and hope and pain,
An Easter of unending joy we may at last attain.

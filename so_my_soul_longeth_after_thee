So my soul
Longeth after Thee.

As The Deer

You alone are my
Heart’s desire;
And I long to
Worship Thee.

You alone are my strength,
My shield,
To You alone
May my spirit yield.

You alone are my
Heart’s desire
 And I long 
To worship Thee.

You’re my friend
And You are my brother
Even though You are a King.

I love you
More than any other,
So much more than anything.

You alone are my strength,
My shield,
To You alone
May my spirit yield.

You alone are my
Heart’s desire
 And I long 
To worship Thee.

I want You
More than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy.

You alone
Are the real joy-giver,
And the apple of my eye.

You alone are my strength,
My shield,
To You alone
May my spirit yield.

You alone are my
Heart’s desire
 And I long 
To worship Thee.

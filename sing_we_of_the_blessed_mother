Sing we of the blessed Mother who received the angel's word,
And obedient to the summons bore in love the infant Lord;
Sing we of the joys of Mary at whose breast the child was fed
Who is Son of God eternal and the everlasting Bread.

Sing we, too, of Mary's sorrows, of the sword that pierced her through,
When beneath the cross of Jesus she his weight of suffering knew,
Looked upon her Son and Savior reigning from the awful tree,
Saw the price of our redemption paid to set the sinner free.

Sing again the joys of Mary when she saw the risen Lord,
And in prayer with Christ's apostles, waited on his promised word;
From on high the blazing glory of the Spirit's presence came,
Heavenly breath of God's own being, tokened in the wind and flame.

Sing the greatest joy of Mary when on earth her work was done,
And the Lord of all creation brought her to his heavenly home;
Virgin Mother, Mary blessed, raised on high and crowned with grace,
May your Son, the world's redeemer, grant us all to see his face.

I sing the mighty power of God
That made the mountains rise;
That spread the flowing seas abroad
And built the lofty skies.

I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full
 At His command,
And all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures
 With His word,
And then pronounced them good.

Lord, how Thy wonders
Are displayed,
Where e'er I turn my eye:
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky!

There's not a plant or flower below
But makes Thy glories known;
And clouds arise,
And tempests blow
By order from Thy throne;

While all that borrows life
From Thee
Is ever in Thy care,
And everywhere that man can be
Thou, God, art present There.

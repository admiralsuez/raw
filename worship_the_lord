Worship the Lord
In the beauty of holiness!
Bow down before Him,
His glory proclaim.

With gold of obedience
And incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore Him -
The Lord is His name!

Fear not to enter
His presence in poverty,
Bearing no gifts
To present as your own.

Bring truth in beauty
And love in its purity -
These are the offerings
To lay at His throne.

Some people try to listen to the bottom of a bottle
Some people try to listen to a needle in their arms
Some people try to listen to the money in their pocket
Some people try to listen to another's arms

You and I are not that different
We got a void and we're just trying to fill it up
With something that'll give just a little peace

All we want is a hand to reach to
Open arms that say I love you
We'd give anything to hear the voice of the Savior

Some people try to find it with blind ambition
Some people try to find it where no one else has gone
Some people try to find it in the crowns of victory
Some people get defeated and lose the strength to carry on

You and I are not that different
We got a void and we're just trying to fill it up
With something that'll give just a little peace

All we want is a hand to reach to
Open arms that say I love you
We'd give anything to hear the voice of the Savior
The voice of the Savior

Some people try to find it in the shadow of a steeple
Some people try to find it in the back row pew
Some people try to find it in the arms of Jesus
That's where I found it, how about you?

You and I are not that different
We got a void and we're just trying to fill it up
With something that'll give just a little peace

All we want is a hand to reach to
Open arms that say I love you
We'd give anything to hear the voice of the Savior
The voice of the Savior

We'd give anything to hear the voice of the Savior
The voice of the Savior, the voice of the Savior

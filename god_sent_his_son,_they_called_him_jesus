God sent his son, they called him Jesus;
He came to love, heal and forgive.
He lived and died to buy my pardon;
An empty grave is there to prove my savior lives.

Because he lives I can face tomorrow
Because he lives all fear is gone
Because I know he holds the future 
And life is worth the living 
Just because he lives

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives;
But greater still the calm assurance:
This child can face uncertain day because he lives.

And then one day I'll cross the river;
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then, as death gives way to vict'ry,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he reigns.

Were you there
When they crucified my Lord?
Were you there
When they crucified my Lord?

O, Sometimes it causes me
To tremble, tremble, tremble!
Were you there
When they crucified my Lord?

Were you there
When they nailed Him to the tree?
Were you there
When they nailed Him to the tree?

O, Sometimes it causes me
To tremble, tremble, tremble!
Were you there
When they nailed Him to the tree?

Were you there
When they laid Him in the tomb?
Were you there
When they laid Him in the tomb?

O, Sometimes it causes me
To tremble, tremble, tremble!
Were you there
When they laid Him in the tomb?

Were you there
When he rose up from the dead?
Were you there
When he rose up from the dead?

O, Sometimes I feel like
Shouting “Glory, glory, glory!”
Were you there
When he rose up from the dead?

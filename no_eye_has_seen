No eye has seen
And no ear has heard,
And no mind 
Has ever conceived

The glorious things
That You have prepared
For everyone who has believed.

You brought us near
and you called us your own
And made us joint heirs
with Your Son.

How high and how wide
How deep and how long
How sweet and how strong
Is Your love.

How lavish Your grace;
How faithful Your ways.
How great is your love,
O Lord.

Objects of mercy
Who should have known wrath
We’re filled
With unspeakable joy.

Riches of wisdom,
Unsearchable wealth,
And the wonder
Of knowing Your voice.

You are our treasure
And our great reward;
Our hope 
And our glorious King.

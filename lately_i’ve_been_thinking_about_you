Lately I've been thinkin' about You
And lately I've been dreaming of You
And lately I can't get 
You out of my head
Get You out of my head

Something about the ocean
Makes me rise up and praise
Something about the heavens
Makes me stand in awe again

Something about the sunrise
Reminds me of Your faithfulness
Something about the ocean
And I'm lost in love again

I'll sing until I sense a smile
Upon Your great and lovely face
And till I know Your glory's in this place
Your glory's in this place


Something about the ocean
Makes me rise up and praise
Something about the heavens
Makes me stand in awe again


Something about the sunrise
Reminds me of Your faithfulness
Something about the Ocean
And I'm lost in love again

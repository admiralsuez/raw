All praise to Him who reigns above
All praise to Him who reigns above
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem!

Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord;

Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord.

His Name above all names
Shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord.

Redeemer, Savior,
Friend of man
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, 
Blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name
Of the Lord.

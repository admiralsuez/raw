Well, do you love my Jesus,
Deep down in your soul?
Yes, I love my Jesus
Deep down in my soul!


Deep, deep, down, down,
Deep down in my soul.
Deep, deep, down, down,
Deep down in my soul.


Well, do you love my Jesus,
Deep down in your soul?
Yes, I love my Jesus
Deep down in my soul!


Deep, deep, down, down,
Deep down in my soul.
Deep, deep, down, down,
Deep down in my soul.

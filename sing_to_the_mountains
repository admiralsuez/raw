Sing to the mountains,
sing to the sea.
Raise your voices,
lift your hearts.
This is the day
the Lord has made.
Let all the earth rejoice.

I will give thanks to you, my Lord.
You have answered my plea.
You have saved my soul from death.
You are my strength and song.

Refrain

Holy, holy,
holy Lord.
Heaven and earth
are full of your glory.

Refrain

This is the day that the Lord has made.
let us be glad and rejoice.
He has turned all death to life.
Sing of the glory of God.

Refrain

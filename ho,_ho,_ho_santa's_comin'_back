Ho, ho, ho
Santa's comin' back, around
So get ready
Christmastime is my favorite part of the year
'Cause ah, there's a lot of love in the air
And holiday cheer

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

Everyone knows that Santa's on his way
He's got lots of gifts and goodies on his sleigh, y'all

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

You know he's got toys for every little boy and girl
He's gonna make a stop in every neighborhood 'round the world

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

Grandma's in the kitchen making sure the food's just right
And don't forget grandpa's dinner rolls,
'Cause you know they're outta sight

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town
[x2]

Family and friends so dear to me here
Jingle bells ringin', everybody's singin', we are family

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

As night creeps in
We settle down for bed
And we kiss each child after all the prayers have been said

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

Hey, look up in the sky
There he goes
With Rudolph leading the way
Until everybody knows

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

Now after all the presents have been opened and the dinner consumed
We'll dance down a soul train line in the middle of the living room

He's comin'baka'round
Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town

Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town
[repeat]

Said, Merry Christmas
Said, Merry Christmas
And a very funky New Year

Santa'scomin'baka'round
Santa's comin' to your town
[repeat]

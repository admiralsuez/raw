It is good to give thanks to the Lord
Singing praises to our God on high.
Sing of mercies throughout the day
And Thy faithfulness by night,
And Thy faithfulness by night.

It is good to give thanks to the Lord
Singing praises to our God on high.
Sing of mercies throughout the day
And Thy faithfulness by night,
And Thy faithfulness by night.

I will rejoice in the work of Thy hands,
For Thou hast made me glad.
Thine enemies scatter, 
They fall away;
But the righteous one shall stand!

It is good to give thanks to the Lord
Singing praises to our God on high.
Sing of mercies throughout the day
And Thy faithfulness by night,
And Thy faithfulness by night.

From the strings of an instrument
My offering will pour.
The God of righteousness
Is my Rock,
Exalted evermore!

It is good to give thanks to the Lord
Singing praises to our God on high.
Sing of mercies throughout the day
And Thy faithfulness by night,
And Thy faithfulness by night.

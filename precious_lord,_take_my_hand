Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, help me stand
I am tired, I am weak,
I am worn;

Through the storm, 
Through the night, 
Lead me on to the light,
Take my hand, precious Lord,
lead me home.   

When my way grows drear,
Precious Lord, linger near,
When my life is almost gone,

Hear my cry, hear my call,
Hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand, Precious Lord,
Lead me home.

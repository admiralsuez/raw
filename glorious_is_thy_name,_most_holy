Glorious is Thy name, Most Holy,
God and Father of us all;
We Thy servants bow before Thee,
Strive to answer every call.

Thou with life's great good
Hast blest us,
Cared for us from earliest years;
Unto Thee our thanks we render;
Thy deep love o'ercomes all fears.

For our world of need and anguish
We would lift to Thee our prayer.
Faithful stewards of Thy bounty,
May we with our brothers share.

In the name of Christ or Savior,
Who redeems and sets us free,
Gifts we bring of heart and treasure,
That our lives may worthier be.

In the midst of time we journey,
From Thy hand comes each new day;
We would us it in Thy service,
Humbly, wisely, while we may.

So to Thee, Lord and Creator,
Praise and honor we accord,
Thine the earth and
Thine the heavens,
Through all the Eternal Word.

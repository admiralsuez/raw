I have fixed my eyes on your hills, Jerusalem, my Destiny.
Though I cannot see the end for me I cannot turn away.

We have set our hearts for the way; this journey is our destiny.
Let no one walk alone. The journey makes us one.

Other spirits, lesser gods, have courted me with lies.
Here among you I have found a truth that bids me rise.

Refrain

See, I leave the past behind; a new land calls to me.
Here among you now I find a glimpse of what might be.

Refrain

In my thirst, you let me drink the waters of your life,
Here among you I have met, the Savior, Jesus Christ.

Refrain

All the worlds I have not seen you open to my view.
Here among you I have found a vision bright and new.

Refrain

To the tombs I went to mourn the hope I thought was gone,
Here among you I awoke to unexpected dawn.

Refrain

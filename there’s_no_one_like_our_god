There's no one like our God, 
No one at all. 
He gave His Son for us, 
Jesus the Lord

Who can love us like He does?
No one at all...  
Oh, how we love You, Lord!

You are high 
Above all nations;
Your glory shines 
Above the heavens

Humbled Yourself to 
Love and save us.
Be praised throughout 
Endless generations!

There's no one like our God, 
No one at all. 
He gave His Son for us, 
Jesus the Lord

Who can love us like He does?
No one at all...  
Oh, how we love You, Lord!

You lift the needy from the ashes
And seat them high up
With up with the princes

You give the barren 
woman healing;
She'll dance for joy 
Like the mother of children!

There's no one like our God, 
No one at all. 
He gave His Son for us, 
Jesus the Lord

Who can love us like He does?
No one at all...  
Oh, how we love You, Lord!

There's no one like our God, 
No one at all. 
He gave His Son for us, 
Jesus the Lord

Who can love us like He does?
No one at all...  
Oh, how we love You, Lord!

There's no one like our God, 
No one at all. 
He gave His Son for us, 
Jesus the Lord

Who can love us like He does?
No one at all...  
Oh, how we love You, Lord!

Creator of the stars of night, 
Thy people's everlasting light, 
Jesu, Redeemer, save us all, 
And hear Thy servants when they call. 
 
Thou, grieving that the ancient curse 
Should doom to death a universe, 
Hast found the medicine, full of grace, 
To save and heal a ruined race. 
 
Thou cam'st, the Bridegroom of the bride, 
As drew the world to evening-tide; 
Proceeding from a virgin shrine, 
The spotless Victim all divine. 
 
At Whose dread Name, majestic now, 
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow; 
And things celestial Thee shall own, 
And things terrestrial, Lord alone. 
 
O Thou Whose coming is with dread 
To judge and doom the quick and dead, 
Preserve us, while we dwell below, 
From every insult of the foe. 
 
To God the Father, God the Son, 
And God the Spirit, Three in One, 
Laud, honor, might, and glory be 
From age to age eternally.

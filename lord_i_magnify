Lord I magnify 
I glorify 
I give my praise to You  
Lord I Magnify 
I glorify  
I give my praise to You - (Repeat)

I Stand in awe of Your presence  
Humbly I bow before Your Throne  
I lift my hands to You 
in reverence  
To worship You Lord You alone  
Yes Lord - (Repeat chorus twice)  
(Repeat 1st verse) - 
(Repeat chorus...)

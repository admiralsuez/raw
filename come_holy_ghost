Come Holy Ghost, Creator come from Thy bright heavenly throne,
Come take possession of our souls and make them all thy own.
 Thou who art called Paraclete, best gift of God above.
The living spring, the living fire, sweet unction and true love.
 
Thou who art sevenfold in thy grace Finger of God's right hand;
His promise teaching little ones to speak and undertand.
 
O guide our minds with thy blest light, with love our hearts inflame;
And with thy strength which ne're decays confirm our mortal frame.
 
Far from us drive our deadly foe; true peace unto us bring;
And through all perils lead us safe
Beneath thy sacred wing.
 
Through Thee may we the Father know; through Thee the eternal Son
And thee the Spirit of them both thrice blessed Three in One.

Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known,
Join in a song of sweet accord,
Join in a song of sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.

We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion, 
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God,
But children of the heavenly King,
But children of the heavenly King
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad.

We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion, 
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Before we reach the heavenly fields
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion, 
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Then let our songs abound
And every tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high.

We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion, 
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

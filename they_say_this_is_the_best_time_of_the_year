They say this is the best time of the year
And for most of us that's probably how it feels
But what about the ones left alone
And all the people hurting,
Looking for a glimpse of hope

We could be that shining light
To show the heart of Christmas time
People need love
And we all are able
So take some time and start today
To give some joy and hope away
'Cause you might be
You might be
Somebody's angel

We run and run
We fill our schedules up
The gifts, the rush
Consume us all so much
Salvation army Santa's ringing his bell
Giving us a little reminder
There's a world that needs our help

We could be that shining light
To show the heart of Christmas time
People need love
And we all are able
So take some time and start today
To give some joy and hope away
'Cause you might be
You might be
Somebody's angel

This Christmas
Don't miss it
The chance to love someone right where they are
Don't miss it
Don't miss it

We could be that shining light
To show the heart of Christmas time
People need love
And we all are able
So take some time and start today
To give some joy and hope away
'Cause you might be
You might be
Somebody's angel

'Cause you might be, somebody's
Christmas angel
Somebody's Christmas angel

My hope is in the Lord
Who gave Himself for me,
And paid the price of all my sin
At Calvary.

For me He died,
For me He lives,
And everlasting life and light
He freely gives.

No merit of my own
His anger to suppress,
My only hope is found
In Jesus' righteousness.

For me He died,
For me He lives,
And everlasting life and light
He freely gives.

And now for me He stands
Before the Father's throne,
He shows His wounded hands,
And names me as His own.

For me He died,
For me He lives,
And everlasting life and light
He freely gives.

His grace has planned it all,
'Tis mine but to believe,
And recognize His work of love
And Christ receive.

For me He died,
For me He lives,
And everlasting life and light
He freely gives.

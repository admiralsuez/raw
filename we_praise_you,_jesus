We praise You, Jesus;
We praise You, Lord.
We sing songs of freedom;
We dance with joy!

We praise You, Jesus;
We praise You, Lord.
We sing songs of freedom;
We dance with joy!

You've taken our weeping
And turned it into dancing;
Taken our heaviness away,
Far away!

We praise You, Lord.
We sing songs of freedom;
We dance with joy!

You've taken our weeping
And turned it into dancing;
Taken our heaviness away,
Far away!

We praise You, Lord.
We sing songs of freedom;
We dance with joy!

We praise You, Lord.
We sing songs of freedom;
We dance with joy!

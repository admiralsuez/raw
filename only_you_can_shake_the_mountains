Only You... Can shake the mountains.
Only You... Can calm the oceans.
Only You... Can hold the heavens,
In the palm of Your hand.

Tell me who... Can look inside me.
Tell me who.. Can purify me.
Tell me who.. Still loves me deeply,
More than I understand-
Only You...

With a word You spoke the heavens into place
Scattered stars and gave the earth its frame
What is man that You should 
Touch Him with Your grace?
And who am I oh God,
That You should know my name?

Only You... Can shake the mountains.
Only You... Can calm the oceans.
Only You... Can hold the heavens,
In the palm of Your hand.

Tell me who... Can look inside me.
Tell me who.. Can purify me.
Tell me who.. Still loves me deeply,
More than I understand-
Only You...

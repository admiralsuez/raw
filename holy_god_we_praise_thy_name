Holy God we praise Thy name
Lord of all we bow before Thee
All on earth Thy septre claim.
All in heaven above adore Thee
Infinite is thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.

Hark, the loud celestial hymn.
Angel choirs above are raising.
Cherubim and Seraphim
in unceasing chorus praising.
Fill the heavens with sweet accord, 
"Holy, holy, holy, Lord!"

Holy Father, holy Son, holy Spirit, three we name Thee.
While in essence only One, Undivided God we claim Thee.
And adoring bend the knee, while we own the mystery.
(on CD Cry in the Wilderness)

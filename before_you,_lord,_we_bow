Before You, Lord, we bow,
O God who reigns above,
And rules the world below,
In boundless power and love.

Our thanks we bring!
In joy and praise,
Our hearts we raise,
To You, high King!

May every mountain height,
Each vale and forest green,
Shine in Your Word's pure light,
And may its fruits be seen!

May every tongue
Be tuned to praise
And join to raise
A grateful song.

Earth, hear your Maker's voice,
Your great Redeemer own;
Believe, obey, rejoice,
And worship Him alone.

Cast down your pride,
Your sin deplore
And bow before
The Crucified!

And when in power He comes,
Oh, may our native land
Send forth a people saved
By Your almighty hand:

A countless throng,
Ever to sing
To heaven's high King
Salvation's song!

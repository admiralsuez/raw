Caught a glimpse of 
Your splendor, 
In the corner of my eye

The most beautiful thing 
I'd ever seen

It was like a flash of lightning, Reflected off the sky,
 And I know I'll never be the same.

Show me Your glory.
Send down Your presence.
I want to see Your face.

Show me Your glory.
Majesty shines about You and
I can't go on without You, Lord.

When I climb down the mountain, 
And get on with my life,
I won't settle for ordinary things.

I'm gonna follow Your forever,
For all of my days.
I won't rest until I see You again.

Show me Your glory.
Send down Your presence.
I want to see Your face.

Show me Your glory.
Majesty shines about You and
I can't go on without You, Lord.

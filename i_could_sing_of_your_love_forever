I Could Sing of Your
Love Forever

Over the mountains and the seas, 
your river runs with love for me, 
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free.

I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my hands, for I will always sing of when your love came down!

I could sing of your love forever!
I could sing of your love forever!
(repeat)

Oh! I feel like dancing.
It's foolishness I know,
but when the world has seen the light, they will dance with joy like we're dancing now!


I could sing of your love forever!
I could sing of your love forever!
(repeat)

Over the mountains and the seas, 
your river runs with love for me, 
And I will open up my heart and let the healer set me free.

I'm happy to be in the truth and I will daily lift my hands, for I will always sing of when your love came down!

I could sing of your love forever!
I could sing of your love forever!
(repeat)

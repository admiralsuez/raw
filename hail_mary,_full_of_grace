Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with you.
Blessed are you among women
And blest is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary Mother of God,
Pray for us sinners,
Now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

You were chosen by the Father,
You were chosen for the Son,
You were chosen from all women,
And for woman, shining one.

Blessed are you among women.
Blest in turn all women too.
Blessed they with peaceful spirits.
Blessed they with gentle hearts.

Chorus
Gentle woman, quiet light,
Morning star,
So strong and bright, gentle Mother,
Peaceful dove, teach us wisdom,
Teach us love.

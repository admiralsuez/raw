Abba Father, we approach Thee
In our Savior's precious name.
We, the children of Your mercy,
Bow before Your throne today.

Free from guilt His blood
Has washed us;
Now, through Him,
Our souls draw nigh.
By Your Spirit You inspire us,
“Abba Father” is our cry.

Abba Father, we will worship
With the angels up above;
They will join with us in wonder
At this miracle of love.

Here before Your throne together
All Your children
Praise Your name.
By the sacrifice of Jesus,
Abba Father, we proclaim!

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,
To His feet your tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King!

Angels in the height, adore Him;
You behold Him face to face.
Saints triumphant, bow before Him;
Gathered in from every race.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise with us the God of grace!

Mortals, join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began;
Father love is reigning o'er us,
Brother love binds man to man.

Thou our Father, Christ our brother,
All who live in love are Thine.
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the joy divine.
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the joy divine.

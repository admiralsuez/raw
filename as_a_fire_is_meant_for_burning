As a fire is meant for burning with a bright and warming flame
So the Church is meant for mission, giving glory to God's name.
Not to preach our creeds or customs, but to build a bridge of care,
We join hands across the nations, finding neighbors ev'rywhere.

We are learners; we are teachers; we are pilgrims on the way.
We are seekers,; we are givers; we are vessels made of clay.
By our gentle loving actions we should show that Christ is light.
In a humble list'ning Spirit, we would live to God's delight.

As a green bud in the springtime is a sign of life renewed,
So may we be signs of oneness 'mid earth's peoples, many hued.
As a rainbow lights the heavens when a storm is past and gone,
May our lives reflect the radiance of God's new and glorious dawn.

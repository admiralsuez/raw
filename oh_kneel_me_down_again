Oh kneel me down again
Here at Your feet
Show me how much You love Humility

Oh spirit be the star
That leads me to
The humble heart of love
I see in You

Cuz You are the God of the broken
The friend of the weak
You wash the feet of the weary
Embrace the ones in need
And I want to be like you Jesus
To have this heart in me
You are the God of the humble
You are the humble King

You are the God of the humble
You are the humble King

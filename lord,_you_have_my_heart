Lord, you have my heart,
And I will search for yours
Jesus take my life and lead me on
(repeat)

Men: And I will praise you, Lord!
Women: I will praise you, Lord!

Men: And I will sing of love come down.

Women: I will sing of love come down.

Men: And as you show your face,

Women: Show your face...

All: 
	We'll see your glory here!

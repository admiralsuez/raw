Beautiful Lord, Wonderful Saviour
I know for sure all of my days are
Held in Your hands
Crafted into Your perfect plan

You gently call me 
into Your presence
Guiding me by Your Holy Spirit
Teach me dear Lord
To live all of my life
Through Your eyes

I’m captured by Your Holy calling
Set me apart, I know You’re drawing
Me to Yourself Lead me Lord I pray

Take me, mould me, use me, fill me
I give my life to the Potter’s hand
Call me, Guide me, lead me,
walk beside me
I give my life to the Potter’s hand

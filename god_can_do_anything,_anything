God can do anything, anything,
Anything, God can do anything 
But fail.
He can save, He can keep,
He can cleanse and He will.
God can do anything but fail.

He's the Alpha and Omega,
The Beginning and the End.
He's the fairest of ten thousand
To my soul. God can do anything,
 anything, anything, 
God can do anything but fail.

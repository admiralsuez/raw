No other Name but the name of Jesus
No other Name but the name of the Lord
No other Name but the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory, and worthy of honor
And worthy of power and all praise

His Name is exalted
Far above the earth
His Name is high above the heavens
His Name is exalted
Far above the earth
Give glory and honor
And praise unto His Name

The Lord said he'll answer
All of our prayers
When we cry out in His Name
His name is power
Awesome to behold
Give glory and honor
And praise unto His Name

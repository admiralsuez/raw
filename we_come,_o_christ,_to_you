We come, O Christ, to You,
True Son of God and man,
By Whom all things consist,
In Whom all life began:

In You alone
We live and move,
And have our being
In Your love.

You are the Way to God,
Your blood our ransom paid;
In You we face our Judge
And Maker unafraid.

Before the throne
Absolved we stand,
Your love has met
Your law’s demand.

You are the living Truth!
All wisdom dwells in You,
The Source of every skill,
The One Eternal True!

Great I AM!
In You we rest,
Sure answer to
Our every quest.

You only are true Life,
To know You is to live
The more abundant life
That earth can never give:

Risen Lord!
We live in You,
In us each day
Your life renew!

We worship You, Lord Christ,
Our Savior and our King,
To You our youth and strength
Adoringly we bring:

So fill our hearts,
That all may view
Your life in us,
And turn to You!

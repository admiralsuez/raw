Down at Your feet, oh Lord,
Is the most high place.
In Your presence, Lord,
I seek Your face; I seek Your face.

There is no higher calling,
No greater honor
Than to bow and kneel
Before Your throne.

I'm amazed at Your glory,
Embraced by Your mercy,
Oh Lord, I live to worship You.

Down at Your feet, Oh Lord,

We seek Your face;

There is no higher calling,
No greater honor
Than to bow and kneel
Before Your throne.

I'm amazed at Your glory,
Embraced by Your mercy,
Oh Lord, I live to worship You.

He leadeth me! O blessed thought!
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
Whate’er I do, where’er I be,
Still ‘tis God’s hand that leadeth me!

He leadeth me,
He leadeth me,
By His own hand
He leadeth me:

His faithful follower
I would be,
For by His hand
He leadeth me.

Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since ‘tis Thy hand that leadeth me!

He leadeth me,
He leadeth me,
By His own hand
He leadeth me:

His faithful follower
I would be,
For by His hand
He leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy Grace, the victory’s won,
Even death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me!

He leadeth me,
He leadeth me,
By His own hand
He leadeth me:

His faithful follower
I would be,
For by His hand
He leadeth me.

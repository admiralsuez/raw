My Jesus, I Love Thee
I know Thou art mine.
For Thee, all the follies
Of sin I resign.

My gracious Redeemer,
My Savior art Thou.
If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee because
Thou hast first loved me.
And purchased my pardon
On Calvary's tree.

I love Thee for wearing
The thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus 'tis now.

I'll love Thee in life 
I will love Thee in death.
And praise Thee as long 
As Thou lendest me breath.

And say when the death dew
Lies cold on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, 'tis now."

In mansions of glory
And endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee
In heaven so bright;

I'll sing with the glittering
Crown on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee,
My Jesus, 'tis now."

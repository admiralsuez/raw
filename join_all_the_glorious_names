Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love, and power,
That ever mortals knew,
That angels ever bore:

All are too poor
To speak His worth,
Too poor to set
My Savior forth.

Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name:
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came,

The joyful news
Of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued
And peace with heaven.

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:

His powerful blood
Did once atone
And now it pleads
Before the throne.

Thou art my Counselor,
My Pattern and my Guide,
And Thou my Shepherd art;
O, keep me near Thy side;

Nor let my feet
E'er turn astray
To wander
In the crooked way.

My Savior and my Lord,
My Conqueror and my King,
Thy scepter and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace, I sing:

Thine is the power;
Behold, I sit
In willing bonds
Beneath Thy feet.

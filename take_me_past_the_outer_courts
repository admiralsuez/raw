Take me past the outer courts
Into the Holy place
Past the brazen altar
Lord, I want to see Your face
Take me through these crowds of people
And the priests who sing Your righteousness
And it's only found in one place


Take me into the Holy of Holies,
Take me in by the blood of the lamb
Take me into the Holy of Holies,
Take the coal, cleanse my lips,here I am

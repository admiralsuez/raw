1. Life can be so good, Life can be so hard, never knowing what each day will bring to where you are.
Sometimes I forget, And sometimes I can't see that whatever comes my way, you'll be with me.
Refrain: My life is in your hands , my heart is in your keeping.
I'm never without hope, not when my future is with you.
My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly,
I will lift my voice and sing, 'cause your love does amazing things.
Lord, I know my life is in your hands...
2. Nothing is for sure, Nothing is for keeps.
All I know is that your love will live eternally.
So I will find my rest and I will find my peace,
Knowing that you'll meet my every need.
Refrain: My life is in your hands , my heart is in your keeping.
I'm never without hope, not when my future is with you.
My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly,
I will lift my voice and sing, 'cause your love does amazing things.
Lord, I know my life is in your hands...
Bridge: When I'm at my weakest, oh you carry me. Then I become my strongest Lord, in your hands.

Final Refrain: My life is in your hands , my heart is in your keeping.
I'm never without hope, not when my future is with you.
My life is in your hands, and though I may not see clearly,
I will lift my voice and sing, 'cause your love does amazing things.
Lord I know my life is in your hands.
I trust you Lord, my life is in your hands.

King Jesus is all,
My all in all, 
And I know that He'll answer, 
Me when I call, 

(Echo after each line)

Walkin' by my side, 
I'm satisfied. 
King Jesus is all, 
My All in All! 

(Echo after each line)

Well, I went out to meet the Lord.
(Oh yeah!)
I got down on my knees. 
(knees, knees...)
I said my very first prayer.
(Amen!)
You know the Holy Ghost met me there,
(uh-uh-uh)

I stepped on the rock.
The rock was sound.
Ooh, the love of Jesus came a tumblin' down
The reason I know that He saved my soul-
I dug down deep and I found pure gold!
And He's All..

King Jesus is all, 
My all in all,
And I know that he'll answer,
Me when I call,
Walkin' by my side,
I'm satisfied. 
King Jesus is all, 
My All in All!

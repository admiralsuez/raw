Lord you seem so far away
A million miles or more it feels today
Though I haven't lost my faith
I must confess right now
That it's hard for me to pray

I don't know what to say
I don't know where to start
But as you give the grace
with all that's in my heart

I will sing I will praise
Even in my darkest hour
Through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing I will praise
Lift my hands to honour you
Because your word is true
I will sing

Lord it's hard for me to see
All the thoughts and plans
You have for me
But I will put my trust in You
Knowing that died to set me free

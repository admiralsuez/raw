You are my love and my light
You are my purpose for 
You are my hope in the night 
My reason for singing

You bring the joy to my life
(And You're) Making it better and better
And I will give thanks forever and ever

Will we ever know
What we have been given He has chosen us and called us
His own Flowing from His throne
There is a river
Bringing life and health wherever it goes

We will bless Your name Always and ever
And offer up the sacrifices of praise
Teach us Lord we pray
To live in Your presence
Make us more more
Like You everyday

Oh oh oh What a joy to know 
Oh oh oh Our Father loves us so  (Repeat chorus 2 times) 
And I will give thanks Forever and ever

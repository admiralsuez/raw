Holy, You are still Holy,
Even when the darkness surrounds my life.
Sovereign, You are still Sovereign,
Even when confusion had blinded my eyes.

You Are Still Holy

Lord, I don't deserve Your kind affection,
When my unbelief has kept me from your touch.
I want my life to be a pure reflection
Of Your love!

So I come into Your chambers
and I dance at Your feet, Lord.

You are my Savior and I'm at Your mercy.
All that has been in my life up 'til now
Belongs to You…

You are still Holy,
Even when the darkness surrounds my life.
Sovereign, You are still Sovereign,
Even when confusion had blinded my eyes.

You are still Holy,
Even when the darkness surrounds my life.
Sovereign, You are still Sovereign,
Even when confusion had blinded my eyes.
I belong to You!

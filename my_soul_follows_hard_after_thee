My soul follows hard after Thee,
Early in the morning
Will I rise up and seek Thee;

And because Thou
Hast been my help
Under the shadow of Thy wing,
I will rejoice.

My soul follows hard
After Thee,
Early in the morning
Will I rise up and seek Thee;

And because Thou
Hast been my help
Under the shadow of Thy wing,
I will rejoice, I will rejoice.

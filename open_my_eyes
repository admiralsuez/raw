Open my eyes, 
That I may see
Glimpses of truth
Thou hast for me;

Place in my hands
The wonderful key,
That shall unclasp
And set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my eyes, illumine me,
Spirit divine!

Open my ears,
That I may hear
Voices of truth
Thou sendest clear;

And while the wave-notes
Fall on my ear,
Everything false
Will disappear.

Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my ears, illumine me,
Spirit divine!

Open my mouth
And let it bear
Gladly the warm truth
Everywhere;

Open my heart
And let me prepare
Love with Thy children
Thus to share.

Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my heart, illumine me,
Spirit divine!

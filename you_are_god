You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You Forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You knew me before 
I took my first breath
And You know the day that
I will breathe the last

You're the Alpha, Omega, 
Beginning and End
Forever to You I sing...

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

Into Your hands 
I commit my spirit
You're the only One 
Who satisfies my soul.

You're the Alpha, Omega, 
Beginning and End
Forever to You I sing...

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

You are God.
You are Life.
I will worship 
You forever!

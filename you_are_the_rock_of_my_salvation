In time of need,
Lord unto You will I cleave.

You are the Rock of my salvation.
You are the strength of my life

Lord, unto You will I cry.

I believe in You, believe in You
For Your faithful love to me.

In time of need,
Lord unto You will I cleave.

You are the Rock
Of my salvation,
You are the Strength
Of my life.

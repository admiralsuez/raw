Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes,
Our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still
Be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

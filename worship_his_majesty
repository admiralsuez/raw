Majesty,
Worship His Majesty.
Unto Jesus be all
Glory, honor, and praise.

Majesty, kingdom authority
Flow from His throne
Unto His own;
His anthem raise.

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus.
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus, the King.

Majesty, worship His majesty;
Jesus who died,
Now glorified,
King of all kings.

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus.
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus, the King.

Majesty, worship His Majesty;
Jesus who died,
Now glorified,
King of all kings.

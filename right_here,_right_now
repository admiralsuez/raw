Right here, right now,
As we join our hearts together;
Right here, right now,
As we seek Your holy touch;

Let Your Spirit come upon us;
Let the mighty river flow.
We are here because we need You
And we want so much to grow.

Right here, right now,
Be enthroned upon our praises.
Right here, right now,
Let Your Spirit fill this place

'Til we're lost within Your glory,
'Til the world looks strangely dim;
And we taste the love of Jesus,
And we give our all to Him.

Right here we sing
To the King of all kings.
Right now we bow
To the Savior of our souls.

We seek Your face
In the way that we know how,
So touch us with Your Spirit
Right now.

Right here, right now,
We are hungry and we're thirsty;
Right here, right now,
You're the one we're longing for;

Shine Your light upon our darkness,
Come and cleanse us from our sin.
Give us ears so we can hear You,
Light the fire in us again.

Right here, right now,
Be enthroned upon our praises.
Right here, right now,
Let Your Spirit fill this place

'Til we're lost within Your glory,
'Til the world looks strangely dim;
And we taste the love of Jesus,
And we give our all to Him.
Right here, right now.

OH LET THE SON OF GOD ENFOLD YOU ,WITH HIS SPIRIT AND HIS LOVE.
LET HIM FILL YOUR HEART AND SATISFY YOUR SOUL.
OH  LET HIM HAVE THE THINGS THAT HOLD YOU AND HIS SPIRIT LIKE A DOVE,
WILL DESCEND UPON YOUR LIFE AND MAKE YOU WHOLE.
(CHORUS) JESUS, OH JESUS COME AND FILL YOUR LAMBS  (x 2)
O come and sing this song with gladness as your hearts are filled with joy.
Give your hands in sweet surrender to His Name.
O give Him all your tears and sadness, give Him all your years of pain,
And you'll enter into Life in Jesus' Name.   ( repeat CHORUS)

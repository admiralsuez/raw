Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand-
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;

A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noon-tide heat
And the burden of the day.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;

And from my smitten heart with tears
Two wonders I confess -
The wonders of redeeming love
And my unworthiness.

I take, O cross, they shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine
Than the sunshine of His face;

Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.

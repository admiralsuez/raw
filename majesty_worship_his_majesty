Majesty worship His Majesty 
Unto Jesus, be all glory,
Power and praise 
Majesty, Kingdom authority 
Flow from His throne, 
Unto his own, His anthem raise. 

So exalt, lift up on high
The Name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify,
Christ Jesus the King
Majesty, worship His Majesty 
Jesus who died, now glorified,
King of all Kings.

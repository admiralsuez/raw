I'm so very ordinary,
Nothing special on my own.
Oh, I have never walked on water,
And I have never calmed a storm.

Sometimes I'm hiding away
From the madness around me,
Like a child who's afraid
Of the dark.

But when I call on Jesus
All things are possible.
I can mount on wings
Like eagles and soar.

When I call on Jesus
Mountains are gonna fall,
‘Cause He'll move heaven and earth
To come rescue me when I call.

(La la la, la, la.) 2x
Mountains are gonna fall,
‘Cause He'll move heaven and earth
To come rescue me when I call.

Weary brother,
Broken daughter,
Widowed, widowed lover,
You're not alone.

If you're tired and scared
Of the madness around you,
If you can't find
The strength to carry on,

When you call on Jesus
All things are possible.
You can mount on wings
Like eagles and soar.

When you call on Jesus
Mountains are gonna fall,
‘Cause He'll move heaven and earth
To come rescue you when you

Call Him in the mornin'
In the afternoontime,
Late in the evening,
He'll be there.

When your heart is broken
And you feel discouraged,
You can just remember that
He said He'll be there.

But when I call on Jesus
All things are possible.
I can mount on wings
Like eagles and soar.

When I call on Jesus
Mountains are gonna fall,
‘Cause He'll move heaven and earth
To come rescue me

When I call on Jesus
All things are possible.
I can mount on wings
Like eagles and soar.

When I call on Jesus
Mountains are gonna fall,
‘Cause He'll move heaven and earth
To come rescue me when I call.
(La la la, la, la.) 3x

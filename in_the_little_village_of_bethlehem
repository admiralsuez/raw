In the little village of Bethlehem,
There lay a Child one day,
And the sky was bright
With a holy light
O'er the place where Jesus lay.

Alleluia! O how the angels sang.
Alleluia! How it rang!
And the sky was bright
With a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King.

'Twas a humble birthplace, but oh,
How much God gave to us that day,
From the manger bed
What a path has led,
What a perfect holy way.

Alleluia! O how the angels sang.
Alleluia! How it rang!
And the sky was bright
With a holy light,
'Twas the birthday of a King.

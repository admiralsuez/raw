O breathe on me, O breath of God, 
fill me with life anew that I may love 
the things You love, and do what you would do.

O breathe on me, O breath of God, 
until my heart is pure; 
until my will is one with Yours, 
to do and to endure.

O breathe on me, O breath of God, 
my will to Yours incline, 
until this selfish part of me 
glows with Your fire divine.

O breathe on me, O breath of God, 
so I shall never die, 
but live with You the perfect life 
for all eternity.

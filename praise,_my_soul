Praise, My Soul,
The King of Heaven

Praise, my soul,
The King of heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;

Ransomed, healed,
Restored, forgiven,
Evermore His praises sing;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.

Praise Him
For his grace and favor
To our fathers in distress;

Praise Him, still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Glorious in His faithfulness.

Frail as summer's flower
We flourish;
Blows the wind
And it is gone;

But, while mortals rise and perish,
God endures unchanging on:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the high Eternal One

Angels in the height,
Adore Him;
Ye behold Him
Face to face;

Saints triumphant, bow before Him;
Gathered in from every race;
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise with us the God of grace.

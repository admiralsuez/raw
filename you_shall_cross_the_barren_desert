You shall cross the barren desert,
But you shall not die of thirst.
You shall wander far in safety,
Though you do not know the way.
You shall speak your words in foreign lands
And all will understand.
You shall see the face of God and live.

Be not afraid.
I go before you always.
Come follow Me.
And I will give you rest.

If you pass through raging waters,
In the sea you shall not drown.
If you walk amid the burning flames,
You shall not be harmed.
If you stand before the power of hell,
And death is at your side.
Know that I am with you through it all.

Refrain

Blessed are your poor,
For the kingdom shall be theirs.
Blest are you that weep and mourn,
For one day you shall laugh.
And if wicked men insult and hate you,
All because of Me.
Blessed, blessed are you.

Refrain

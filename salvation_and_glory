Salvation and glory
Belong to our God
And unto the Lamb
On the throne;

Blessing and honor,
Wisdom and power
Be unto God alone.
Hallelujah, Glory to the Lamb;
Hallelujah to the great I AM.

We lift up Your name,
O Lord,
Worthy the Lamb who was slain,
Taking all our pain;

We lift up Your name,
O Lord,
Giving You honor and praise
With our hands upraised
To You, Lord.

What wondrous love is this,
O my soul, O my soul.
What wondrous love is this,
O my soul

What wondrous love is this 
That caused the Lord of bliss
To bear the dreadful curse 
for my soul, for my soul.
To bear the dreadful curse 
for my soul.

To God and to the Lamb
I will sing, I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb I will sing,
To God and to the Lamb 
Who is the great “I Am”,

While millions join the theme,
I will sing,
I will sing,
While millions join the them,
I will sing.

And when from death I'm free,
I'll sing on, I'll sing on,
And when from death I'm free,
 I'll sing on,
And when from death I'm free
I'll sing and joyful be,

And through eternity
I'll sing on,
 I'll sing on,
And through eternity
I'll sing on.

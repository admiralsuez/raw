Marvelous grace
Of our Loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin
And our guilt!

Yonder on Calvary's
Mount out-poured
There where the blood
Of the Lamb was spilt.

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that will pardon
And cleanse within,

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that is greater
Than all our sin!

Sin and despair,
Like the sea-waves cold,
Threaten the soul
With infinite loss;

Grace that is greater-
Yes, grace untold
Points to the refuge,
The mighty cross.

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that will pardon
And cleanse within,

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that is greater
Than all our sin!

Dark is the stain
That we cannot hide,
What can avail
To wash it away?

Look! There is flowing
A crimson tide,
Whiter than snow
You may be today.

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that will pardon
And cleanse within,

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that is greater
Than all our sin!

Marvelous, infinite,
Matchless grace,
Freely bestowed
On all who believe!

You that are longing
To see His face,
Will you this moment
His grace receive?

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that will pardon
And cleanse within,

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that is greater
Than all our sin!

Grace, grace
God's grace,
Grace that will pardon
And cleanse within,

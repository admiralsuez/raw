O Come, O Come, Emmanuel
    O Come, O Come, Emmanuel
     And ransom captive Israel
   That mourns in lonely exile here
    Until the Son of God appear.

      Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel
      Shall come to you, O Israel

  O come, O Wisdom from on high,
   Who orders all things mightily;
  To us the path of knowledge show,
   And teach us in her way to go.

                Chorus

O come, O come, great Lord of might
Who to your tribes, on Sinai's height
 In ancient times once gave the law
   In cloud and majesty and awe.

                Chorus

   O come, O rod of Jesse's stem
    From every foe deliver them
That trust your mighty power to save
 And give them vict'ry o'er the grave

                Chorus

   O come, O Key of David, come
  And open wide our heavenly home
 Make safe the way that leads on high
    And close the path to misery.

                Chorus

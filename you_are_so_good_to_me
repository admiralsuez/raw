You are so good to me,
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in Heaven

You are so good to me,
You heal my broken heart
You are my Father in Heaven

You are beautiful 
My sweet, sweet song 
(3x)
I will sing again,
I will sing again,

You ride upon the clouds,
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me.

You ride upon the clouds,
You lead me to the truth
You are the Spirit inside me.

You are beautiful 
My sweet, sweet song 
(3x)
I will sing again,
I will sing again,

You are my strong melody,
You are my dancing rhythm,
You are my perfect rhyme,
And I want to sing forever

You poured out all Your blood,
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me

You poured out all Your blood,
You died upon the cross
You are my Jesus who loves me

You are beautiful 
My sweet, sweet song 
(3x)
I will sing again,
I will sing again,

You are beautiful 
My sweet, sweet song 
(3x)
I will sing again,
I will sing again,

You are my Father in Heaven,
You are the Spirit inside me,
You are my Jesus
Who loves me.

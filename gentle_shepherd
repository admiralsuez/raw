Gentle Shepherd,
Come and lead us,
For we need You
To help us find our way. 

Gentle Shepherd,
Come and feed us,
For we need Your strength
From day to day.

There’s no other
We can turn to
Who can help us
Face another day;

Gentle Shepherd,
Come and lead us,
For we need You
To help us find our way.

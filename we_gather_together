We gather together
To ask the Lord's blessing;
He chastens and hastens
His will to make known;

The wicked oppressing
Now cease from distressing,
Sing praises to His name:
He forgets not His own.

Beside us to guide us,
Our God with us joining,
Ordaining, maintaining
His kingdom divine;

So from the beginning
The fight we were winning:
Thou Lord, wast at our side,
All glory be Thine!

We all do extol Thee,
Thou Leader triumphant,
And pray that Thou still
Our defender wilt be.

Let Thy congregation
Escape tribulation:
Thy name be ever praised!
O Lord, make us free!

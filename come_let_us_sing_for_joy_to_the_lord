Come let us sing for joy to the Lord, And honour the Mother of Jesus 
For He is our God and She brings us to Him.  
She's the Woman clothed with the Sun. 
Sing halle, halleluia, sing halle luia. 
Sing halle, halleluia, sing halle halleluia.
(Prayer spoken) 
- Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Father, send now your Spirit over the earth 
Let the Holy Spirit live in the hearts of all nations, that they may be preserved 
from degeneration, disaster and war.  
And may the Lady of all Nations who once was Mary, 
be our Advocate.  
Sing halle halleluia sing halle luia etc 
Sing Ave Maria, sing halle, halleluia.

I'm here to meet with you
Come and meet with me.
I’m here to find You
Reveal Yourself to me.

As I wait,
You make me strong.
As I long,
You draw me to Your arms.

As I stand,
And sing Your praise,
You come, You come
And You fill this place

Won’t You come, 
Won’t You come 
And fill this place?

I'm here to meet with you
Come and meet with me.
I’m here to find You
Reveal Yourself to me.

As I wait,
You make me strong.
As I long,
You draw me to Your arms.

As I stand,
And sing Your praise,
You come, You come
And You fill this place

Won’t You come, 
Won’t You come 
And fill this place?

As I wait,
You make me strong.
As I long,
You draw me to Your arms.

As I stand,
And sing Your praise,
You come, You come
And You fill this place

As I wait,
You make me strong.
As I long,
You draw me to Your arms.

As I stand,
And sing Your praise,
You come, You come
And You fill this place

Won’t you come, 
Won’t you come 
And fill this place?
Lord, come, Lord, come
And fill this place

I'm here to 
Meet with You...
Come and meet with me...

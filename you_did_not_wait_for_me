You did not wait for me
To draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself
With frail humanity.

You did not wait for me
To cry out to You
But You let me hear
Your voice calling me.

And I知 forever grateful
To You,
I知 forever grateful 
For the cross,

I知 forever grateful to You 
That You came
To seek and save the lost.

I知 forever grateful
To You,
I知 forever grateful 
For the cross,

I知 forever grateful to You 
That You came
To seek and save the lost.

You did not wait for me
To draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself
With frail humanity.

You did not wait for me
To cry out to You
But You let me hear
Your voice calling me.

And I知 forever grateful
To You,
I知 forever grateful 
For the cross,

I知 forever grateful to You 
That You came
To seek and save the lost.

And I知 forever grateful
To You,
I知 forever grateful 
For the cross,

I知 forever grateful to You 
That You came
To seek and save the lost.

Forever Grateful
I知 forever grateful
To You,
I知 forever grateful 
For the cross,

You did not wait for me
To draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself
With frail humanity.

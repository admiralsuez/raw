Our Father, Who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done
On earth as it is in Heaven.

The Lord's Prayer

Give us this day our daily bread 
And forgive us our debts
As we forgive our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil,

For Thine is the Kingdom,
And the power
And the glory forever,
Amen.

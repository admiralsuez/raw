Cant stop talking 'bout everything He's done
Its the best thing, happened since the world began
It didn't come cheap but I got it for free
Its the hope of glory, Christ in me

He helped me to see when my spirit was blind
Its amazing if you look just what you'll find
Every step I took, He took two
If He did it for me, He can do it for you

Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)
Do you know what I say is true?
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)
If He did it for me, He can do it for you

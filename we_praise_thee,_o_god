We praise Thee, O God,
For the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Revive us again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior
And scattered our night.

Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Revive us again.

All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins
And has cleansed every stain.

Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Revive us again.

Revive us again
Fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
 With fire from above.

Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Hallelujah, Amen!
Hallelujah, Thine the glory!
Revive us again.

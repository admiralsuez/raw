What a friend 
I've found,
Closer than a brother.

I have felt 
Your touch
More intimate 
than lovers

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 Friend forever...

What a hope I've found,
More faithful than a mother
It would break my heart, 
To ever lose each other.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 Friend forever...

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
 Friend forever...

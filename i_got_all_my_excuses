I got all my excuses
I got my list of fears
I've counted all the reasons
Why you've called
The wrong hero
To be here

It's not safe,
It's just not worth it
Doing the right thing
Is just too hard
But I believed those lies
Long enough
And I'm not gonna
Listen anymore

'Cause I remember
You said
When all hope is gone
Help will come and

Give me strength
To go farther
And climb higher
Courage that burns
Inside like a fire
No turning back
This is the day

I will do what
I need to
And when I need you
I know you're
Love will come
To the rescue
No turning back
This is the day
I do the right thing

So what if I'm not
The strongest
A little weaker than
I'd like to be
Even I can do what's
Right because
I know the king is
Calling me

To live a life worth
Looking up to
Holding on to what
Matters most
Nobody said it was
Gonna be easy
But I know I will
Never go alone

'Cause when all
Hope is gone
Help will come
Come from above

And give me strength
To go farther
And climb higher
Courage that burns
Inside like a fire
No turning back
This is the day

I will do what
I need to
And when I need you
I know you're
Love will come
To the rescue
No turning back
This is the day
I do the right thing

Give me strength
To go farther
And climb higher
Courage that burns
Inside like a fire
No turning back
This is the day

I will do what
I need to
And when I need you
I know you're
Love will come
To the rescue
No turning back

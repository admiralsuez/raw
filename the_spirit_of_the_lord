The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty in me.

The Spirit of the Lord 
Is great and mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty in me.

Greater is He that is in me
Than he that is in the world.
I am more than a conqueror
By the Power of His Word,
Of His Word!

The Spirit of the Lord 
Is great and Mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty in me.

The Spirit of the Lord 
Is great and mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty in me!

In the name of Jesus,
I can do anything;
By the power of His Spirit,
Through the One who strengthens me
Strengthens me;

The Spirit of the Lord 
Is great and mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty is He.

The Spirit of the Lord 
Is great and mighty
The Spirit of the Lord
Is my victory;

The Spirit of the Lord
Is great and mighty;
Great and mighty is He!

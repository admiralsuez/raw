O the blessed contemplation,
When with trouble here I sigh:
I've a home beyond the river,
That I'll enter by and by.

I've A Home Beyond The River

I've a home beyond the river,
I've a mansion bright and fair;
I've a home beyond the river-
I will dwell with Jesus there.

Just a little more to labor,
Tell the story, watch and pray;
Just a few more earthly sorrows,
Then to heaven we'll fly away.

I've a home beyond the river,
I've a mansion bright and fair;
I've a home beyond the river-
I will dwell with Jesus there.

O how sweet 'twill be to meet them-
All the ransomed host above;
Sweeter still to see the Savior,
Praise Him for redeeming love.

I've a home beyond the river,
I've a mansion bright and fair;
I've a home beyond the river-
I will dwell with Jesus there.

Tho' the world is filled with sorrow,
And the teardrops often fall,
There will be but joy and gladness,
Safe inside the jasper wall.

I've a home beyond the river,
I've a mansion bright and fair;
I've a home beyond the river-
I will dwell with Jesus there.

Tho' the hills are rough and stony,
And the valleys dark and cold,
I must walk the path before me-
It will someday turn to gold.

I've a home beyond the river,
I've a mansion bright and fair;
I've a home beyond the river-
I will dwell with Jesus there.

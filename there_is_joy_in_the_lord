There is joy in the Lord,
There is love in His Spirit,
There is hope in the knowledge
Of Him.

There’s a fountain that flows
Like a river from Heaven,
Abounding in love
To my soul.

All blessing and honor are His.
All glory and power are His.
Let all wisdom and strength
Be the Lord’s in this place;
Let all glory be given to Him.

There is joy in the Lord,
There is love in His Spirit,
There is hope in the knowledge
Of Him.

There’s a fountain I know,
Every time I am near it,
My heart overflows
To the Lord.

All blessing and honor are His.
All glory and power are His.
Let all wisdom and strength
Be the Lord’s in this place;
Let all glory be given to Him.

There is joy in the Lord,
There is love in His Spirit,
There is hope in the knowledge
Of Him.

There’s a fountain that flows
Like a river from Heaven,
Abounding in love
To my soul.

There is joy in the Lord,
There is love in His Spirit,
There is hope in the knowledge
Of Him.

There’s a fountain that flows
Like a river from Heaven,
Abounding in love to my soul,
Abounding in love to my soul.

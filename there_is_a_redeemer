There is a Redeemer 
Jesus, God’s own Son;
Precious Lamb of God Messiah, 
Holy One.

Thank You, oh, my Father,
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit 'til
The work on earth is done.

Jesus, my Redeemer,
Name above all names;
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
O for sinners slain.

Thank You, oh, my Father,
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit 'til
The work on earth is done.

When I stand in Glory,
I will see His face,
There I’ll serve my King forever
In that holy place.

Thank You, oh, my Father,
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit 'til
The work on earth is done.

Thank You, oh, my Father,
For giving us Your Son,
And leaving Your Spirit 'til
The work on earth is done.

There is a Redeemer 
Jesus, God’s own Son;
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah, 
Holy One.

Jesus, my Redeemer,
Name above all names;
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah,
O for sinners slain.

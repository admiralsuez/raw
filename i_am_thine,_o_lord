I am Thine, O Lord, 
I have heard Thy voice 
And it told Thy love to me.

I Am Thine, O Lord

But I long to rise 
In the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer,
Nearer blessed Lord
To the cross
Where Thou hast died.

Draw me nearer, nearer,
Nearer blessed Lord
To Thy precious bleeding side.

Consecrate me now 
To Thy service,  Lord,
By the power of grace divine;

Let my soul look up
With a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Draw me nearer,
Nearer blessed Lord
To the cross
Where Thou hast died.

Draw me nearer, nearer,
Nearer blessed Lord
To Thy precious bleeding side.

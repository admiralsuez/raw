How firm a foundation
Ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith
In His excellent Word!

What more can he say
Than to you he hath said,
To you who for refuge
To Jesus have fled?

“Fear not, I am with thee;
O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God
And will still give thee aid;”

“I'll strengthen thee, help thee,
And cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My righteous
Omnipotent hand.”

“When through fiery trials
Thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient,
Shall be thy supply:”

“The flame shall not hurt thee;
I only design
Thy dross to consume
And thy gold to refine.”

“The soul that on Jesus
Hath leaned for repose
I will not, I will not
Desert to its foes;”

“That soul, though all hell
Should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no, never,
No, never forsake!”

“The soul that on Jesus
Hath leaned for repose
I will not, I will not
Desert to its foes;”

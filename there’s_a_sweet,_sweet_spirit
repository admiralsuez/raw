There's a sweet, sweet Spirit
In this place,
And I know that it's the
Spirit of the Lord;

There are sweet expressions
On each face,
And I know that it's the
Presence of the Lord.

Sweet Holy Spirit,
Sweet heavenly Dove,
Stay right here with us,
Filling us with Your love;

And for these blessings
We lift our hearts in praise:
Without a doubt we'll know 
That we have been revived,
When we shall leave this place.

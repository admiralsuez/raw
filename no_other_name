No other name
But the name of Jesus,
No other name
But the name of the Lord;

No other name
But the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor,
And worthy of power and all praise.

No other name

No other name
But the name of the Lord;

No other name
But the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor,
And worthy of power and all praise.

His name is exalted
Far above the earth,
His name is high
Above the heavens;

His name is exalted
Far above the earth,
Give glory and honor
And praise unto His name.

No other name
But the name of Jesus,
No other name
But the name of the Lord;

No other name
But the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor,
And worthy of power and all praise.

No other name
But the name of Jesus,
No other name
But the name of the Lord;

No other name
But the name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor,
And worthy of power and all praise.

He’s worthy of glory
He’s worthy of honor,
He’s worthy of power
And all praise.

When He shall come,
Resplendent in His glory,
To take His own
From out this vale of night,

O may I know
The joy at His appearing
Only at morn
To walk with Him in white!

When I shall stand
Within the court of heaven
Where white-robed pilgrims
Pass before my sight

Earth's martyred saints
And blood-washed overcomers
These, then are they
Who walk with Him in white!

When He shall call,
From earth's remotest corners,
All who have stood
Triumphant in His might,

O to be worthy
Then to stand beside them,
And in that morn
To walk with Him in white!

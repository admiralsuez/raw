If you want joy, real joy,
 Wonderful joy, true joy,
Let Jesus come into your heart;

If you want joy, real joy,
 Wonderful joy, true joy,
Let Jesus come into your heart;

Your sins He’ll wash away,
Your night He’ll turn to day,
Your life He’ll make over anew.

If you want joy, real joy,
Wonderful joy, true joy,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

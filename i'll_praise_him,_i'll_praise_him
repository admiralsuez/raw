I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him
Praise Him forever

I shall dwell, under the shadow
of the Almighty
He is my rock and my refuge
I will cling to Him

Hallelujah Praise the Lord
Hallelujah Praise the Lord

I shall tread on the Lion and the adder
I shall trample them
He has given me Power and Authority
Over the enemy

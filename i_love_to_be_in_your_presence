I love to be in Your presence,
With Your people, singing praises;
I love to stand and rejoice, 
Lift my hands and raise my voice.

I love to be in Your presence,
With Your people, singing praises;
I love to stand and rejoice, 
Lift my hands and raise my voice.

You set my feet to dancing,
You fill my heart with song;
You give me reason to rejoice, 
Rejoice!

I love to be in Your presence,
With Your people, singing praises;
I love to stand and rejoice, 
Lift my hands and raise my voice.

Lift my hands,
Lift my hands,
Lift my hands,
And raise my voice!

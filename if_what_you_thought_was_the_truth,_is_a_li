If what you thought was the truth, is a lie
And what you thought to keep on breathing has died
You faced the lonely nights and wrestled with the dark
And you reach to find the love to fill the space inside your heart

It's hard to put it into words, the way you feel
It's a naked emptiness that lingers still
Are you a victim of the past without a trace of hope inside?
And it all goes by so fast without a way to make it right
If you worry, don't worry

God will come and wrap His arms around You
It wouldn't be too much for Him
To love You as He found You

And it may seem like You're too far gone
But He loves you like His only son
And He will come, He will come

From the bounty of a river, there's a flow
From the beauty of the Father's heart's a home
That never leaves you empty, no, and never leaves you bare
So come and bring your guilt and shame, come and leave it there
If you're weary, He's willing

God will come and wrap His arms around You
It wouldn't be too much for Him
To love You as He found You

And it may seem like You're too far gone
But He loves you like His only son
And He will come

Oh, you don't have to be worthy
You don't have to be anything
But willing to fall into His arms
Willing to fall into His arms

God will come and wrap His arms around You
It wouldn't be too much for Him
To love You as He found You

And it may seem like You're too far gone
But He loves you like His only son
He will come

I’M TRADING MY SORROWS
I’M TRADING MY SHAME
I’M LAYING THEM DOWN
FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD

I’M TRADING MY SICKNESS
I’M TRADING MY PAIN
I’M LAYING THEM DOWN
FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD
YES LORD YES LORD
YES YES LORD			
AMEN



I’M TRADING MY SORROWS 3

I’M PRESSED BUT NOT CRUSHED
PERSECUTED NOT ABANDONED
STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT
DESTROYED
I AM BLESSED BEYOND THE CURSE
FOR HIS PROMISE WILL ENDURE
THAT HIS JOY’S GONNA BE

I’M TRADING MY SORROWS

MY STRENGTH
THOUGH THE SORROW MAY LAST FOR THE NIGHT
HIS JOY COMES IN THE MORNING
YES LORD YES LORD
YES YES LORD
AMEN 


I’M TRADING MY SORROWS 3

Come, all Christians, be committed
To the service of the Lord.
Make your lives for Him more fitted,
Tune your hearts with one accord.

Come into His courts with gladness,
Each his sacred vows renew,
Turn away from sin and sadness,
Be transformed with life anew.

Come in praise and adoration,
All who on Christ’s name believe.
Worship Him with consecration,
Grace and love will you receive.

For His grace give Him the glory,
For the Spirit and the Word,
And repeat the gospel story
‘Til all men His name have heard.

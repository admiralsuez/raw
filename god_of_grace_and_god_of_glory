God of grace and God of glory,
On Thy people pour Thy power;
Crown Thine ancient Church’s story,
Bring her bud to glorious flower.

Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
For the facing of this hour,
For the facing of this hour.

Lo! The hosts of evil round us
Scorn Thy Christ, assail His ways!
From the fears that long have bound us,
Free our hearts to faith and praise.

Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
For the living of these days,
For the living of these days.

Cure Thy children’s warring madness;
Bend our pride to Thy control;
Shame our wanton, selfish gladness,
Rich in things and pour in soul.

Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal,
Lest we miss Thy kingdom’s goal.  

Set our feet on lofty places,
Gird our lives that they may be
Armored with all Christ-like graces
In the fight to set men free.

Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
That we fail not man nor Thee,
That we fail not man nor Thee.

Save us from weak resignation
To the evils we deplore;
Let the search for Thy salvation
Be our glory evermore.

Grant us wisdom,
Grant us courage,
Serving Thee, whom we adore,
Serving Thee, whom we adore.

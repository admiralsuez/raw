The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon you,
Because He has anointed you to preach good news.

He has sent you to the poor.	
This is the year
To bind up the broken hearted, 
This is the day

To bring freedom to the captives,
This is the year
And to release the ones in darkness.


The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon us,
Because He has anointed us to preach good news.
(repeat)


He will comfort all who mourn,
This is the year
He will provide for those who grieve,
This is the day

He will pour out the oil of gladness,
This is the year
Instead of mourning you will praise!


This is the year, 
of the favor of the Lord!
This is the day, 
of the vengeance of our God!
(repeat)

There's the wonder
Of sunset at evening,
The wonder as sunrise I see;

But the wonder of wonders
That thrills my soul
Is the wonder
That God loves me.

O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think
That God loves me.

O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think
That God loves me.

There's the wonder
Of springtime and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;

But the wonder of wonders
That thrills my soul
Is the wonder
That's only begun.

O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think
That God loves me.

O, the wonder of it all!
The wonder of it all!
Just to think
That God loves me.

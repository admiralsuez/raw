No superman, I'm no hero

The father of all lies

Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always

Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!

No superman, I'm no hero
I'm just a man in Your eyes
But through Your Son I've overcome
The father of all lies

Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always
Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always

Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always
Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always

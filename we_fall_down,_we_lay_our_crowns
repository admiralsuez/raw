We fall down, we lay our crowns
At the feet of Jesus.
The greatness of mercy and love
At the feet of Jesus.

And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy!”
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy!”
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lamb!”

We fall down, we lay our crowns
At the feet of Jesus.
The greatness of mercy and love
At the feet of Jesus.

And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy!”
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy!”
And we cry, “Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lamb!”
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lamb!”

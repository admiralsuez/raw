Everything I am,
Everything I have,
Everything I can
I bring to You.

For You alone are worthy,
So I come to give You praise.
And everything I am
I bring to You.

Everything I am,
Everything I have,
Everything I can
I bring to You.

For You alone are worthy,
So I come to give You praise.
And everything I am
I bring to You.

Everything I am,
Everything I have,
Everything I can
I bring to You.

For You alone are worthy,
So I come to give You praise.
And everything I am
I bring to You.

Everything I am,
Everything I have,
Everything I can
I bring to You.

For You alone are worthy,
So I come to give You praise.
And everything I am I bring to You.
Everything I am I bring to You.

Hungry, I come to you
For I know You satisfy
I am empty, but I know
Your love does not run dry
And so I wait for you
So I wait for You
I'm falling on my knees
Offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for

Broken, I run to You
For Your arms are open wide
I am weary, but I know
Your touch restores my life

Jesus Christ, I think about your sacrifice.
You became nothing,
Poured out to death.


Many times I致e wondered at your gift of life,
And I知 in that place once again!
Yes, I知 in that place once again!

And once again I look upon that cross where You died
I知 humbled by your mercy 
and I知 broken inside!
And once again I thank You,
And once again I lay down my life.


Now You are exalted 
to the highest place.
King of the heavens, 
Where one day I値l bow,


But for now,
I marvel at your saving grace,
And I知 full of praise once again!
Yes, I知 full of praise once again!

And once again I look upon that cross where You died
I知 humbled by your mercy 
and I知 broken inside!


And once again I thank You,
And once again I lay down my life.

Thank you for the cross,
Thank you for the cross,
Thank you for the cross my friend...

We will give ourselves no rest
‘Til Your kingdom comes on earth;
We've positioned watchmen
On the wall.

Now our prayers will flow like tears,
For You've shared 
Your heart with us.
God of heaven,
On our knees we fall.

Come down, in power;
Reveal Your heart again.
Come hear our cries,
The tears that plead for rain.

We're knocking,
Knocking on the door of heaven.
We're crying,
Crying for this generation.
We're praying for Your name
To be known in all of the earth.

We're watching,
Watching on the walls to see You.
We're looking,
Looking for  a time of breakthrough.

We're praying for Your Word
To bear fruit
In all of the earth,
All of the earth.

We will give ourselves no rest

Once in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,

Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.

He came down to earth from heaven
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall:

With the poor,
And mean, and lowly
Lived on earth,
Our Savior holy.

Jesus is our childhood's pattern,
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us He knew:

And He feeleth
For our sadness,
And He shareth
In our gladness.

And our eyes at last shall see Him
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above,

And He leads His children on
To the place
Where He has gone.

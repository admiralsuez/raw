The love of God is broader
Than earth's vast expanse,
'Tis deeper and wider
Than the sea.

Love reaches out to all
To bring abundant life,
For God so loved the world
His only Son He gave.

Share His love by telling
What the Lord has done for you,
Share His love
By sharing of your faith,

And show the world
That Jesus Christ is real to you
Every moment,
Every day.

All those who have trusted
In God's only Son,
And hold this precious treasure
In their hearts,

Seek ways to make it known
To all who need to know
That God so loved the world
His only Son He gave.

Share His love by telling
What the Lord has done for you,
Share His love
By sharing of your faith,

And show the world
That Jesus Christ is real to you
Every moment,
Every day.

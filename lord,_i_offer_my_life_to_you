Lord, I offer my life to you,
Everything I've been through,
Use it for your glory;

I Offer My Life

Lord, I offer my days to you,
Lifting my praise to you,
As a pleasing sacrifice,
Lord, I offer you my life.

All that I am, 
All that I have
I lay them down
Before you, O Lord;

I Offer My Life

All my regrets, 
All my acclaim,
The joy and the pain,
I'm making them yours.

Lord, I offer my life to you,
Everything I've been through,
Use it for your glory;

Lord, I offer my days to you,
Lifting my praise to you,
As a pleasing sacrifice,
Lord, I offer you my life.

Things in the past,
Things yet unseen,
Wishes and dreams that are
Yet to come true;

All of my hopes,
All of my plans
My heart and my hands
Are lifted to you.

Lord, I offer my life to you,
Everything I've been through,
Use it for your glory;

Lord, I offer my days to you,
Lifting my praise to you,
As a pleasing sacrifice,
Lord, I offer you my life.

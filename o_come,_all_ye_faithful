O come, all ye faithful, 
Joyful and triumphant, 
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem; 
Come and behold Him, 
Born the King of Angels;

O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ, the Lord. 

Sing, choirs of angels, 
Sing in exultation, 
O sing all ye bright host of heaven above; 
Glory to God, 
All glory in the highest; .

O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ, the Lord. 

Yea, Lord we greet thee, 
Born this happy morning, 
Jesus, to thee be all glory given; 
Word of the Father, 
Now in flesh appearing; 

O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
O come, let us adore Him, 
Christ, the Lord.

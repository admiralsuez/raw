Brethren, we have met to worship
And adore the Lord our God;
Will you pray with all your power,
While we try to preach the Word?

All is vain unless the Spirit
Of the Holy One comes down;
Brethren, pray, and holy manna
Will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely,
Let us love each other too;
Let us love and pray for sinners
‘Til our God makes all things new.

Then He'll call us home to heaven,
At His table we'll sit down;
Christ will gird Himself and serve us
With sweet manna all around.

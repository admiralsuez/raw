Every day I look to you
To be the strength of my life.
You're the hope I hold on to,
Be the strength of my life.

Be the strength of my life,
Strength of my life,
Be the strength of my life today.

Every day I look to you
To be the strength of my life.
You're the hope I hold on to,
Be the strength of my life.

Be the strength of my life,
Strength of my life,
Be the strength of my life today.

In loving kindness Jesus came
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Through grace He lifted me.

From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night
To plains of light
O praise His name, He lifted me! 

He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
Forgiven He lifted me.

From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night
To plains of light
O praise His name, He lifted me! 

His brow was pierced
With many a thorn,
His hands with cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
In love He lifted me.

From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night
To plains of light
O praise His name, He lifted me! 

Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know 'tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me.

From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night
To plains of light
O praise His name, He lifted me!

The first Noel,
The angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay; 

The First Noel

In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the east,
Beyond them far,

And to the earth
It gave great light,
And so it continued
Both day and night.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

And by the light
Of that same star
Three wise men came
From country far;

To seek for a king
Was their intent,
And to follow the star
Wherever it went.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

This star drew nigh
To the northwest,
O'er Bethlehem
It took its rest,

And there it did
Both stop and stay,
Right over the place
Where Jesus lay.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

The entered in
Those wise men three,
Full reverently
Upon their knee,

And offered there
In His presence
Their gold, and myrrh,
And frankincense.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

Then let us all
With one accord
Sing praises
To our heavenly Lord,

That hath made heaven
And earth of naught,
And with His blood
Mankind hath bought.

Noel, Noel,
Noel, Noel,
Born is the King
Of Israel.

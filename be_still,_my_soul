Be still, my soul: 
The Lord is on thy side.

Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain.

Leave to your God to order and provide;

In every change, He faithful will remain.

Be still, my soul: 
Your best, your heavenly Friend

Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

Be still, my soul: 
Your God will undertake
To guide the future, as He has the past.
Your hope, your confidence let nothing shake;
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.

Be still, my soul:
The waves and winds shall know

His voice Who ruled them while He dwelt below.

Be still, my soul:
The hour is hastening on
When we shall be forever with the Lord.
When disappointment, grief 
And fear are gone,
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.

Be still, my soul:
When change and tears are past.

All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.

O Lord my God, 
When I in awesome wonder 
Consider all The works 
Thy Hand hath made, 
I see the stars, 
I hear the mighty thunder, 
Thy pow'r throughout 
The universe displayed; 

Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God, to Thee, 
How great Thou art! How great Thou art! 
Then sings my soul, 
My Saviour God, to Thee, 
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

When through the woods 
And forest glades I wander 
I hear the birds 
Sing sweetly in the trees; 
When I look down 
From lofty mountain grandeur 
And hear the brook 
And feel the gentle breeze; 

When Christ shall come, 
With shouts of acclamation,

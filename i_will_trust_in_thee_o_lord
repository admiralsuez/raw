I will trust in thee O Lord

When you are my shepherd
I shall not want
You make me to lie down
in green, green pasture

Though the enemies surround me
And the world be against me
My God is my refuge
My strength in my trouble

Ay though I walk through
Death shadowed valley
I fear no evil
Your rod and staff comfort me

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
I shall dwell with my Lord God
In His house forever

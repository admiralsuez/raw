Every day
I see more of Your beauty
Every day 
I know more of my frailty, Lord

I can only hope that 
I’ll be changed
Even as I look 
Upon Your face

For the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever, 
They’re on You forever!

Yes, the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever,
They’re on You forever!

Every day I see 
More of Your greatness
Everyday I know
More of my weakness, Lord

I can only hope that 
I’ll be changed
Even as I look 
Upon Your face

For the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever, 
They’re on You forever!

Yes, the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever,
They’re on You forever!

I’m in love with You, Jesus
(x3)

I’m in love with You, Jesus
(x3)

For the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever, 
They’re on You forever!

Yes, the eyes of my heart
They’re on You forever,
They’re on You forever!

I’m in love with You, Jesus
(x3)

I’m in love with You, Jesus
(x3)

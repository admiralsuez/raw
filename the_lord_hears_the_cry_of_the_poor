The Lord hears the cry of the poor, blessed be the Lord.

Verse 1
I will bless the Lord at all times
with praise ever in my mouth.
Let my soul glory in the Lord
who hears the cry of the poor.

Verse 2
Let the lowly hear and be glad;
the Lord listens to their pleas;
And to hearts broken God is near;
who hears the cry of the poor.

Verse 3
Every spirit crushed God will save;
will be ransom for their lives;
will be safe shelter for their fears,
and will hear the cry of the poor.

Verse 4
We proclaim your greatness, O God,
Your praise ever in our mouth;
Every face brightened in your light,
For you hear the cry of the poor.

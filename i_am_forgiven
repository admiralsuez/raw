I am forgiven 
because you were forsaken
I am accepted 
you were condemned
I am alive and well
your spirit lives within me
because you died and rose again

Amazing love How can it be, 
That you are my king
would die for me,
Amazing love
I know its true
Its my joy to honour you
In all I do, I honour you

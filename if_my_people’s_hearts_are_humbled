If My people's hearts are humbled,
If they pray and seek My face;
If they turn away from evil,
I will not withhold My grace. 

I will hear their prayers
From Heaven;
I will pardon every sin.
If My people's hearts are humbled,
I will surely heal their land.

Then My eyes will see
Their sorrow,
Then My ears will hear their plea,
If My people's hearts are humbled,
I will set their nation free.

If My people's hearts are humbled,
If they pray and seek My face;
If they turn away from evil,
I will not withhold My grace.

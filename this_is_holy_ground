This is holy ground.
We're standing on holy ground.
For the Lord is present and 
Where He is is holy.

This is holy ground.
We're standing on holy ground.
For the Lord is present and 
Where He is is holy.

These are holy hands.
He's given us holy hands.
He works through these hands
And so these hands are holy.

These are holy hands.
He's given us holy hands.
He works through these hands
And so these hands are holy.

This is holy ground.
We're standing on holy ground.
For the Lord is present and 
Where He is is holy.

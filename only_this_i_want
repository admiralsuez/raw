Only this I want:
but to know the Lord,
and to bear his cross
so to wear the crown he wore.

All but this is loss,
worthless refuse to me,
for to gain the Lord
is to gain all I need.

Refrain

I will run the race;
I will fight the good fight,
so to win the prize
of the Kingdom of my Lord.

Refrain

Let your heart be glad,
always glad in the Lord,
so to shine like stars
in the darkness of the night.

Refrain

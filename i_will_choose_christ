I will choose Christ,
I will choose love,
I choose to serve.
I give my heart, I give my life,
I give my all to you.

How many times must he call my name
and show to me that he is God?
And as a servant he calls to me,
"You must serve too."

Christ, my teacher and healer,
teach my heart and heal my soul.
And as I walk this road with you,
teach me to love.

As I look upon your cross,
so too must I die with you.
And with the death of my own desires,
I'll rise with you.
Refrain

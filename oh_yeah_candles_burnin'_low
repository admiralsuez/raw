Oh yeah...
Candles burnin' low,
Lots of mistletoe.
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go.
Choirs singin' carols,
Right outside my door.

All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah,
Ha ha yeah-eah-eah

And you know what I mean
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

[Chorus:]
All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
Whoa!
That's what Chrstmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)

Oh yeah ha ha!
I feel like runnin' wild
As anxious as a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
Oh baby
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill a tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus:]
All these things and more, baby
(All these things and more)
Whoa!
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
Oh yeah

Yeah!
(Candles burnin' low)
(Lots and lots of snow)

Alright!
(Christmas bells are ringin')
(Christmas choirs singin')

Whoo!
(Christmas mistletoe)

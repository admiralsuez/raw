If you know the Lord,
You need nobody else
To see you through
The darkest night.

You can walk alone,
You only need the Lord,
He'll keep you on
The road marked right.

Take time to pray,
Every day,
And when you're headin' home
He'll show you the way.

If you know the Lord,
You need nobody else,
To see the light,
His wonderful light.

I stand to praise you, but I fall on my knees
My Spirit, it is hungry, but my flesh is so weak

Light the fire, in my soul.
Fan the flame;
Make me whole.
Lord You know, where I've been,
So light the fire in my heart again!

I feel Your arms around me,
As the power of your healing begins.
You breathe new life right through me, 
Like a mighty rushing wind.

Light the fire, in my soul.
Fan the flame;
Make me whole.
Lord You know, where I've been,
So light the fire in my heart again!

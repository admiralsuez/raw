Here the story from God's Word
That kings and priests and prophets heard;
There would be a sacrifice
And blood would flow to pay sin's price.

Precious Lamb of glory,
Love's most wondrous story.
Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

On the cross God loved the world
While all the powers of hell were hurled;
No one there could understand
The One they saw was Christ the Lamb.

Precious Lamb of glory,
Love's most wondrous story.
Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

Precious Lamb of glory,
Love's most wondrous story.
Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

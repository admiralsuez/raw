Come, Let us return to the Lord
And He will heal us
Confess our sin to the Lord,
And He Will Restore us

For He longs for us,
To know Him
And to offer Him our lives...

For the Lord, our God is on our side,
And His mercy is upon us;
When we seek the Lord He will not hide,
But like a father He'll draw near us,
Arms open wide

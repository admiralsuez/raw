What a wondrous message
In God's Word!
My sins are blotted out,
I know!

If I trust
In His redeeming blood,
My sins are blotted out,
I know!

My sins are blotted out, I know!
My sins are blotted out, I know!
They are buried in the depths
Of the deepest sea:
My sins are blotted out, I know!

Once my heart was black,
But now what joy,
My sins are blotted out,
I know!

I have peace
That nothing can destroy,
My sins are blotted out,
I know!

My sins are blotted out, I know!
My sins are blotted out, I know!
They are buried in the depths
Of the deepest sea:
My sins are blotted out, I know!

I shall stand someday
Before my King
My sins all blotted out,
I know!

With ransomed host
I then shall sing:
"My sins are blotted out,
I know!"

My sins are blotted out, I know!
My sins are blotted out, I know!
They are buried in the depths
Of the deepest sea:
My sins are blotted out, I know!

I will worship You, Lord,
With all of my might,
I will praise you with a psalm;

I will worship You, Lord,
With all of my might,
I will praise You all day long.

For Thou, O Lord,
Art glorious,
And Thy name
Is greatly to be praised;

May my heart be pure
And holy in Thy sight
As I worship You
With all of my might.

I will worship You, Lord,
With all of my might,
I will praise you with a psalm;

I will worship You, Lord,
With all of my might,
I will praise You all day long.

For Thou, O Lord,
Art glorious,
And Thy name
Is greatly to be praised;

May my heart be pure
And holy in Thy sight
As I worship You
With all of my might.

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand;

Bread of Heaven,
Bread of Heaven,
Feed me ‘til I want no more,
Feed me ‘til I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through;

Strong Deliverer
Strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Bear me through the swelling current,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side;

Songs of praises,
Songs of praises,
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.

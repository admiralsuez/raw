I cannot tell why He,
Whom angels worship
Should set His love
Upon the sons of men,

I Cannot Tell

Or why, as Shepherd, 
He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back,
They know not how or when.

But this I know,
That He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem’s manger
Was His only home,

And that He lived
At Nazareth and labored,
And so the Savior,
Savior of the world, is come.

I cannot tell
How silently He suffered,
As with His peace
He graced this place of tears,

Or how His heart
Upon the cross was broken,
The crown of pain
To three and thirty years.

But this I know,
He heals the brokenhearted,
And stays our sin, 
And calms our lurking fear,

And lifts the burden
From the heavy-laden,
For yet the Savior,
Savior of the world, is here.

I cannot tell
How He will win the nations,
How He will claim
His earthly heritage,

Or satisfy
The needs and aspirations
Of East and West,
Of sinner and of sage.

But this I know,
All flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap
The harvest He has sown,

And some glad day,
His sun shall shine in splendor
When He, the Savior,
Savior of the world, is known.

I cannot tell
How all the lands shall worship,
When, at His bidding,
Every storm is stilled,

Or who can say
How great the jubilation,
When all the hearts of men
With love are filled.

But this I know,
The skies will thrill with rapture,
And myriad, myriad 
Human voices sing,

And earth to heaven,
And heaven to earth will answer:
“At last the Savior,
Savior of the world, is King!”

Blest be the God of Israel who comes to set us free,
And raises up new hope for us, a branch of David's tree.
So have the prophets long declared that with a mighty arm,
God would turn back our enemies and all who wish us harm.

With promised mercy will God still the covenant recall,
The oath once sworn to Abraham from foes to protect us all.
That we might worship without fear and offer lives of praise,
With holiness and righteousness to serve God all our days.

My child, as prophet of the Lord, you will prepare the way,
To tell God's people they are saved from sin's eternal sway.
Then shall God's mercy from on high shine forth and never cease,
To drive away the gloom of death and lead us into peace.

Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His word.
Just to rest upon His promise
Just to know "Thus saith the Lord".

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er.
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus.
O for grace to trust Him more.

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood,
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er.
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus.
O for grace to trust Him more.

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease,
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace.

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er.
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus.
O for grace to trust Him more.

I’m so glad I learned to trust Him,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that He is with me,
Will be with me to the end.

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er.
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus.
O for grace to trust Him more.

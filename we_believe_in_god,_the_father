We believe in God, the Father,
We believe in Christ, the Son,
We believe in the Holy Spirit,
We are the church
And we stand as one.

Holy, holy, holy 
Is our God;
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Is our King!

All glory and honor
Are His to receive;
To Jesus we sing
Because we believe.

We believe in the Holy Bible,
We believe in the virgin birth;
We believe in the resurrection,
That Christ, one day,
Will return to earth.

Holy, holy, holy 
Is our God;
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Is our King!

All glory and honor
Are His to receive;
To Jesus we sing
Because we believe.

We believe in the blood of Jesus,
We believe in eternal life;
We believe in the blood that frees us;
To become the Bride of Christ.

Holy, holy, holy 
Is our God;
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Is our King!

All glory and honor
Are His to receive;
To Jesus we sing
Because we believe.

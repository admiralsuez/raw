Silent night! Holy night,
All is calm, all is bright
Round you virgin mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night! Holy night,
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born

Silent night! Holy night,
Son of God, love's oure light
Radiant beams from thy Holy face
With the dawn of reseeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
By His Love let the walls fall down!


One by one we're drawn together,
One by one to Jesus' side,
One in Him we'll live forever,
Strangers he has reconciled!


Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
By His Love let the walls fall down!


In His love no walls between us,
In a common ground,
Kneeling at the cross of Jesus,
All our pride comes tumbling down.


Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
Let the walls fall down,
By His Love let the walls fall down!

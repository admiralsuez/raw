I am a wounded soldier,
But I will not leave the fight,
Because the great physician is healing me!

So I'm standin' in the battle,
In the armor of His light,
Because His mighty power is real in me!

I am loved,  I am accepted,
By the Savior of my Soul!
I am loved, I am accepted, 
And my sins have been made whole!

I am a wounded soldier,
But I will not leave the fight,
Because the great physician is healing me!

So I'm standin' in the battle,
In the armor of His light,
Because His mighty power is real in me!

I am loved,  I am accepted,
By the Savior of my Soul!
I am loved, I am accepted, 
And my sins have been made whole!

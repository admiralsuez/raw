Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.

Mercy there was great
And grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul
Found liberty - at Calvary.

By God’s Word at last
My sin I learned -
Then I trembled at
The law I’d spurned,
‘Til my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary

Mercy there was great
And grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul
Found liberty - at Calvary.

Now I’ve given to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
To Calvary.

Mercy there was great
And grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul
Found liberty - at Calvary.

Oh the love that drew
Salvation’s plan!
Oh the grace
That brought it down to man!
Oh the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary.

Mercy there was great
And grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul
Found liberty - at Calvary.

Mercy there was great
And grace was free,
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
There my burdened soul
Found liberty - at Calvary.

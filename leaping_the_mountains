Leaping the mountains
bounding the hills,
See how our God
has come to meet us.

His voice is lifted,
his face is joy,
now is the season to
sing our song on high.

Come then O Lord of glory
show us your face.
Speak, for we know your
words are life.

Refrain

He pastures his flock
among the wild flowers
and leads them to the
mountain of his love.

Refrain

All through the day
all through the night
Seek for the Lord
and sing his love.

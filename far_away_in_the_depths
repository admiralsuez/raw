Far away in the depths
Of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody
Sweeter than psalm;

In celestial-like strains
It unceasingly falls
O'er my soul
Like an infinite calm.

Peace! Peace!
Wonderful peace!
Coming down
From the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit
Forever, I pray
In fathomless billows
Of love.

What a treasure I have
In this wonderful peace,
Buried deep in the heart
Of my soul;

So secure that no power
Can mine it away,
While the years
Of eternity roll.

Peace! Peace!
Wonderful peace!
Coming down
From the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit
Forever, I pray
In fathomless billows
Of love.

I am resting tonight
In this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly
In Jesus' control;

For I'm kept from all danger
By night and by day,
And His glory
Is flooding my soul.

Peace! Peace!
Wonderful peace!
Coming down
From the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit
Forever, I pray
In fathomless billows
Of love.

And I think when I rise
To that City of peace,
Where the Author of peace
I shall see,

That one strain of the song
Which the ransomed will sing
In that Heavenly kingdom
Will be:

Peace! Peace!
Wonderful peace!
Coming down
From the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit
Forever, I pray
In fathomless billows
Of love.

O my soul, are you here
Without comfort or rest,
Marching down
The rough pathway of time?

Make the Savior your friend
When the shadows grow dark,
Oh, accept this sweet peace
So sublime.

Peace! Peace!
Wonderful peace!
Coming down
From the Father above;

Sweep over my spirit
Forever, I pray
In fathomless billows
Of love.

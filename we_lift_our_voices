We lift our voices, 
We lift our hands,
We lift our lives up to You,
We are an offering;

Lord, use our voices, 
Lord, use our hands,
Lord, use our lives,
 They are Yours,
We are an offering.

All that we have, 
All that we are,
All that we hope to be
We give to You, 
We give to You.


We lift our voices, 
We lift our hands,
We lift our lives up to You,
We are an offering;

Lord, use our voices, 
Lord, use our hands,
Lord, use our lives,
 They are Yours,
We are an offering.

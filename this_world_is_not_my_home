This world is not my home,
I'm just a passing through,
My treasures are laid up
Somewhere beyond the blue;

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

O Lord, You know
I have no friend like You,
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

They're all expecting me,
And that's one thing I know,
My Savior pardoned me
And now I onward go;

I know He'll take me through
Though I am weak and poor
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

O Lord, You know
I have no friend like You,
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

I have a loving mother
Up in glory-land,
I don't expect to stop
Until I shake her hand;

She's waiting now for me
In heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

O Lord, You know
I have no friend like You,
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

Just up in glory-land
We'll live eternally,
The saints on every hand
Are shouting victory,

Their song of sweetest praise
Drifts back from heaven's shore
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

O Lord, You know
I have no friend like You,
If heaven's not my home
Then Lord what will I do?

The angels beckon me
From heaven's open door
And I can't feel at home
In this world anymore.

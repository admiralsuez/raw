I see You Lord
In Your most holy place
Where angels tremble
And lay down in worship

I stand in wonder
Longing to draw near
You catch my eye
And You call me in

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I see You Lord
In Your most holy place
Where angels tremble
And lay down in worship

I stand in wonder
Longing to draw near
You catch my eye
And You call me in

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

I see you Lord
In Your most holy place
You catch my eye
And You call me in

I fall down...in awe of You

I fall down...in awe of You

                    O Holy Night
            The stars are brightly shining
      It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
     Long lay the world in sin and error pining
    'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
     A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
   For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!
                  Fall on your knees,
              O hear the angels' voices!
                   O night divine,
            O night when Christ was born
  O night divine, O night divine, O night divine!


    Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
   With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
    So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming,
    Here came the wise men from Orient land.
   The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger,
      In all our trials born to be our Friend!
He knows our need; to our weakness is no stranger.
    Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!
    Behold your King; before Him lowly bend!


     Truly He taught us to love one another;
     His law is love and His Gospel is peace.
 Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
    And in His Name all oppression shall cease.
  Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
     Let all within us praise His holy Name!
   Christ is the Lord! O praise His name forever!
     His power and glory evermore proclaim!
     His power and glory evermore proclaim!

In the secret, In the quiet place
in the stillness you are there
In the secret in the quite hour I wait,
Only for you
Cause I want to know you more

In the secret In the quite place
In the stillness you are there
In the secret in the quiet hour I wait
Because I want to know you more

I want to know you 
I want to hear your voice
I want to know you more
I want to touch you 
I want to see your face
I want to know you more

I am reaching for the highest goals
That i might receive the prize
Pressing onward 
Pushing every hindrance aside
Out of my way
Cause i want to know you more

You called me in To your glorious light?
I will not fear 'Cause I'm walking with you
And talking with you From heaven you came
To show me life

You are the light of the world
You are the light of my life?
The hope of the earth my Jesus

I'm gonna be a light and let it shine
Be a light and let it shine

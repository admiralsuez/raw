In times like these
You need a Savior,
In times like these
You need an anchor;

Be very sure,
Be very sure,
Your anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

This Rock is Jesus,
Yes, He's the One,
This Rock is Jesus,
The only One;

Be very sure,
Be very sure,
Your anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

In times like these
You need the Bible,
In times like these
Oh, be not idle;

Be very sure,
Be very sure,
Your anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

This Rock is Jesus,
Yes, He's the One,
This Rock is Jesus,
The only One;

Be very sure,
Be very sure,
Your anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

In times like these
I have a Savior,
In times like these
I have an anchor;

I'm very sure,
I'm very sure,
My anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

This Rock is Jesus,
Yes, He's the One,
This Rock is Jesus,
The only One;

I'm very sure,
I'm very sure,
My anchor holds
And grips the Solid Rock!

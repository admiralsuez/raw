My faith has found a resting place
Not in device or creed;
I trust the Ever-living One
His wounds for me shall plead.

I need no other argument
I need no other plea:
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

Enough for me that Jesus saves
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him
He’ll never cast me out.

I need no other argument
I need no other plea:
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

My heart is leaning on the word
The written word of God;
Salvation by my Savior’s name
Salvation through His blood.

I need no other argument
I need no other plea:
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

My great Physician heals the sick
The lost He came to save:
For me His precious blood He shed
For me His life He gave.

I need no other argument
I need no other plea:
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.

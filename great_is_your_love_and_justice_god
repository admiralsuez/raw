Great is Your love and justice God
You use the weak to lead the strong
You lead us in the song of Your salvation
And all Your people sing along

He became sin Who knew no sin
That we might become His Righteousness
He humbled himself and carried the cross
Love so amazing Love so amazing

Jesus Messiah
Name above all names
Blessed Redeemer Emmanuel
The rescue for sinners
The ransom from Heaven
Jesus Messiah Lord of all

His body the bread
His blood the wine
Broken and poured out all for love
The whole earth trembled
And the veil was torn
Love so amazing Love so amazing

All I hope is in You
All I hope is in You
All the glory to You, God
The light of the world

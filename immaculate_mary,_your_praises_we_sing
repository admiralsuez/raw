Immaculate Mary, your praises we sing;
You reign now in splendor with Jesus our King.

Ave, ave, ave, Maria! Ave, ave, Maria!

Predestined for Christ by eternal decree,
God willed you both virgin and mother to be.

To you by an angel, the Lord God made known
The grace of the Spirit, the gift of the Son.

Most blest of all women, you heard and believed,
Most blest in the fruit of your womb then conceived.

We pray for the Church, our true Mother on earth,
And beg you to watch o'er the land of our birth.

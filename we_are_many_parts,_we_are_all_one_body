We are many parts, we are all one body.
And the gifts we have we are given to share.
May the Spirit of love, make us one indeed.
One, the love that we share; one, our hope in despair,
one, the cross that we bear.

God of all, we look to you,
we would be your servants true,
let us be your love to all the world.

So my pain is pain for you,
in your joy is my joy too,
all is brought together in the Lord!

All you seekers great and small,
seek the greatest gift of all
if you love then you will know the Lord!

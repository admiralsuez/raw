How can I say thanks for the things
You have done for me -
Things so undeserved, yet You give
to prove Your love for me?

The voices of a million angels
could not express my gratitude -
All that I am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to Thee.

To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.

With His blood He has saved me;
With His pow’r He has raised me;
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.

Just let me live my life;
Let it be pleasing, Lord, to Thee.
And should I gain any praise,
Let it go to Calvary.

With His blood He has saved me;
With His pow’r He has raised me;
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.

To God be the glory,
To God be the glory,
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.

With His blood He has saved me;
With His pow’r He has raised me;
To God be the glory
For the things He has done.

How can I say thanks for the things
You have done for me -
Things so undeserved, yet You give
to prove Your love for me?

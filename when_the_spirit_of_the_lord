When the Spirit of the Lord,
moves within my heart,
I will sing like David sang;
When the Spirit of the Lord,
moves within my heart,
I will sing like David sang.

I will sing, I will sing,
I will sing like David sang;
I will sing, I will sing,
I will sing like David sang,

When the Spirit of the Lord,
moves within my heart,
I will clap like David claped
 I will clap I will  clap 
 I will clap like David claped

When the Spirit of the Lord,
moves within my heart,
I will dance like David danced
 I will dance I will dance 
 I will dance like David danced

When the Spirit of the Lord,
moves within my heart,
I will praise like David praised
 I will praise I will praise 
 I will praise like David praised

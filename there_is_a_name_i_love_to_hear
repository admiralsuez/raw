There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest Name on earth.

O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus - 
Because He first loved me!

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.

O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus - 
Because He first loved me!

It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And, though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus - 
Because He first loved me!

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.

O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus,
O, how I love Jesus - 
Because He first loved me!

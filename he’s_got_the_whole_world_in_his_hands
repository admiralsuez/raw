He’s got the whole world
 In His hands,
He’s got the whole world
In His hands,

He’s got the whole world,
In His hands,
He’s got the whole world
In His hands.

He’s got the wind and the rain
In His hands,
He’s got the wind and the rain,
In His hands,
He’s got the wind and the rain
In His hands,
He’s got the whole world
 in His hands.

He’s got the tiny little baby
In His hands,
He’s got the tiny little baby
In His hands,
He’s got the tiny little baby
In His hands,
He’s got the whole world
in His hands.


He’s got you and me brother
In His hands,
He’s got you and me sister
In His hands,
He’s got you and me brother
In His hands,
He’s got the whole world
In His hands.

Stand up and shout it if you love my Jesus!
Stand up and shout it if you love my Lord!
I want to know, oh I want to know, 
If you love my Lord!

Sit down and whisper if you love my Jesus.
Sit down and whisper if you love my Lord.
I want to know, oh I want to know,
If you love my Lord.


Stand up and shout it if you love my Jesus.
Sit down and whisper if you love my Lord.
I want to know, oh I want to know,
If you love my Lord.

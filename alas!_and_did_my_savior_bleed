Alas! And did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I!

At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart
Rolled away,

It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy
All the day!

Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature’s sin.

But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away
‘Tis all that I can do!

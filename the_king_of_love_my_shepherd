The King of love my shepherd is
 Whose goodness fails me never;
I nothing lack if I am his
 And he is mine for ever.

Where streams of living water flow
 My ransomed soul he leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow
 With food celestial feedeth.

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
 But yet in love he sought me,
And on his shoulder gently laid,
 And home, rejoicing, brought me.

In death's dark vale I fear no ill
 With thee, dear Lord, beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
 Thy cross before to guide me.

You spread a table in my sight;
 Your saving grace bestowing;
And oh, what transport of delight
 From your pure chalice flowing!

And so through all the length of days
 Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing thy praise
 Within thy house forever.

King of Hope
I have come to meet with You
To tell You how I really feel
I will not hold back from telling 
You once again

A Thousand Words

A thousand words could never express
The feeling that I have here in my heart
All I can do is tell You again
That I love You

So I bring You my songs 
and I bring You my heart
I lay down my life 
I surrender it all
With everything I am
 I tell You again
I love you
Yes, I love You

Oh Jesus I want to 
thank You for the cross
And the awesome price 
You paid to set me free
You gave Your very life
How could I give You anything less?

A thousand words could never express
The feeling that I have here in my heart
All I can do is tell You again
That I love You

So I bring You my songs 
and I bring You my heart
I lay down my life 
I surrender it all
With everything I am
 I tell You again
I love you
Yes, I love You

A thousand words could never express
The feeling that I have here in my heart
All I can do is tell You again
That I love You

So I bring You my songs 
and I bring You my heart
I lay down my life 
I surrender it all
With everything I am
 I tell You again
I love you
Yes, I love You

Dear God, 
Surround me as I speak
These bridges that 
I walk across are weak

And the frustrations fill 
The void that 
I can't solely bear
Dear God, 
Don't let me fall apart

You've held me close to You
But I have turned away and Searched for answers 
I can't understand

They say that I 
Can move the mountains
And send them 
Falling to the sea
They say that I 
Can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With faith like a child

Sometimes, 
When I feel miles away
And my eyes can't see Your face
Well, I wonder if I've grown
To lose the recklessness 
I walked in light of You

They say that I 
Can move the mountains,
And send them 
Falling to the sea
They say that I 
Can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With faith like a child

They say that I 
Can move the mountains
And send them 
Falling to the sea
They say that I 
Can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With faith like a child

They say that 
Love can heal the broken
They say that
Hope can make you see
They say that
Faith can find a Savior
If you would follow and believe
With faith like a child

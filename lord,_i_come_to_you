Lord, I come to You,
Let my heart be changed, renewed.
Flowing from the grace that I've found in You,


And Lord I've come to know
The weaknesses I see in me, 
will be stripped away,
By the pow'r of Your love!

Hold me close, 
Let Your love surround me!
Bring me near, draw me to Your side.
And as I wait, I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You, 
Your Spirit leads me on 
In the pow'r of Your love!

Lord, unveil my eyes, 
Let me see You face to face
The knowledge of Your love, 
As You live in me
And Lord, renew my mind
As Your will unfolds in my life
In living every day by the pow'r of Your love!

Hold me close, let Your love surround me
Bring me near, draw me to Your side.
And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle
And I will soar with You, 
Your Spirit leads me on 
In the pow'r of Your love!

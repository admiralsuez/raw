I am a christian saved by His blood
I am a christian fill with the Spirit
I am a christian speaking in tongues
I am a christian part of His body
I am a christian called for His work
I am a christian full of His fire
I am a christian shaking the world
I am a christian glory to God

I am part of God's christian band
Marching on through the land 
going forth in His name 
conquering every fort

I am a christian carrying the cross
I am a christian willing to suffer
I am a christian hating the world
I am a christian hating all evil
I am a christian never ashamed
I am a christian standing for Jesus
I am a christian telling my friends
Be a christian living for Jesus

I am a christian fighting to win
I am a christian never defeated
I am a christian under the blood
I am a christian far from all danger
I am a christian praising the Lord
I am a christian ever rejoicing
I am a christian until the end
I am a christian always a christian

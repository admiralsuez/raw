On the wings of a snow-white dove He send His pure sweet love
A sign from above.  On the wings of a dove

When troubles surround us, when evils come.
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb.
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love - on the wings of a dove.  (REPEAT CHORUS)
 
When Jesus went down to the river that day
He was baptized in the usual way.
And when it was done, God blessed His son
He sent Him His love - on the wings of a dove
REPEAT CHORUS

When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some, but wasnn't forgotten
He sent Him His love - on the wings of a dove. (REPEAT CHORUS)

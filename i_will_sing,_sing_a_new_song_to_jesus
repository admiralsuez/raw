I will sing, sing a new song to Jesus
Celebrate His name
I will sing, sing and glorify
And Celebrate the King

He washed me by his blood
He healed me by his stripes
He comforted me thro his words
He strengthened me by his Spirit

I will cling to Thee
I will trust in Thee
You fill my heart with peace
You bless me all my life

Wonderful are you Lord
Counsellor are you Lord
Almighty God forever
King and Lord of Lords

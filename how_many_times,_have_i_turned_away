How many times, have I turned away?
The number is the same as 
the sand on the shore.

But every time, you've taken me back
and now I pray you do it once more.

Please take, for me, my life,
when I don't have the strength
to give it away to You. 

Please take, for me, my life,
when I don't have the strength
to give it away to You, Jesus!


How many times have I turned away?
The number is the same as 
the stars in the sky.

But every time, you've taken me back
and now I pray you do it tonight.

Please take, for me, my life,
when I don't have the strength
to give it away to You. 

Please take, for me, my life,
when I don't have the strength
to give it away to You, Jesus!

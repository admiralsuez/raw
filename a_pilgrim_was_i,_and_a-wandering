A pilgrim was I, and a-wandering
In the cold night of sin I did roam
When Jesus the kind shepherd found me
And now I am on my way home.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

And I shall dwell in the house
Of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table
Spread for me;

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me all the days,
All the days of my life.
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

He restoreth my soul
When I'm weary,
He giveth me strength
Day by day,

He leads me beside
The still waters,
He guards me
Each step of the way.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

And I shall dwell in the house
Of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table
Spread for me;

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me all the days,
All the days of my life.
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

When I walk through
The dark lonesome valley,
My Savior will walk
With me there;

And safely His great hand
Will lead me
To the mansions 
He's gone to prepare.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

And I shall dwell in the house
Of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table
Spread for me;

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me all the days,
All the days of my life.
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow me
All the days, all the days
Of my life.

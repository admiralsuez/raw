Let us break bread together
On our knees.
Let us break bread together
On our knees.

When I fall on my knees
With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord,
Have mercy on me.

Let us drink the cup together
On our knees.
Let us drink the cup together
On our knees.

When I fall on my knees
With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord,
Have mercy on me.

Let us praise God together
On our knees.
Let us praise God together
On our knees.

When I fall on my knees
With my face to the rising sun,
O Lord,
Have mercy on me.

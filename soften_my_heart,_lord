Soften my heart, Lord,
Soften my heart.
From all indifference
Set me apart.

To feel Your compassion
To weep with Your tears.
Come soften my heart,
 Oh Lord,
Soften my heart.

Soften my heart, Lord,
Soften my heart.
From all indifference
Set me apart.

To feel Your compassion
To weep with Your tears.
Come soften my heart,
 Oh Lord,
Soften my heart.

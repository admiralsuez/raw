O safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;

So sinful, so weary,
Thine, Thine would I be;
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noon-tide,
In sorrow痴 lone hour,
In times when temptation
Casts o弾r me its power;

In the tempests of life,
On its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict,
When pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge
And breathed out my woe;

How often, when trials
Like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
O Thou Rock of my soul.

Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest Rock of Ages,
I知 hiding in Thee.

O safe to the Rock
That is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts
And sorrows would fly;

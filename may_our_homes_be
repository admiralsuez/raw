May our homes be
Filled with dancing
May our streets be 
Filled with joy

May injustice 
Bow to Jesus 
As the people 
Turn and pray

May our light shine 
In the darkness,
As we walk before the cross.

May Your glory 
Fill the whole earth,
As the water over the seas.

From the mountain 
To the valley,
Hear our praises rise 
To You!

From the heavens 
To the nations,
Hear the singing 
Fill the air!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah...

From the mountain to the valley,
Hear our praises rise to You!

From the heavens to the nations,
Hear the singing fill the air!
(repeat)

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we all step across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find, we find

It's hanging over him like the clouds of Seattle
And ranin' on his swag fallin' deeper in his saddle
Its written on his face
He don't have to speak a sound
Somebody call the five-o for we gotta man down

You can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that its gonna be a fight ya'll

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day, 
sweeter than the day we call 
out for forgiveness

Forgiveness, we all need, we all need, we all need forgiveness
Forgiveness, we all need, we all need

Mr. Lecrae
My momma told me what I would be in for
If I kept all this anger inside of me pent up
My heart been broken, my wounds been open
And I don't know if I can hear I'm sorry being spoken
But those forgiven much , should be quicker to give it
And God forgave me for it all, Jesus bled forgiveness
So when the stones fly and they aimed at you
Just say forgive them, father, they know not that they do

Now you can go and play it like you're all rock and roll
But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul
And when your head hits the pillow at the nightfall
You can bet your life that its gonna be a fight ya'll

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day, 
sweeter than the day we call
out for forgiveness

No matter how lost you are, you're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how hurt you are, you're not that far, you're not too far
No matter how wrong you are, you're not that far, you're not too far
No matter who you are, you're not that far, you're not too far
From forgiveness
Ask for forgiveness

'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes
And we've all stepped across that line
But nothing's sweeter than the day we find
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And we all stumble and we fall
Bridges burn in the heat of it all
But nothing's sweeter than the day, 
sweeter than the day we call 
out for forgiveness

Forgiveness
We all need, we all need, all need forgiveness
Forgiveness
We all need, we all need

No matter how lost you are, we all need forgiveness
No matter how hurt you are, we all need forgiveness
No matter how wrong you are, you're not that far, you're not too far
No matter who you are, you're not too far, you're not too far

We all need forgiveness, forgiveness
We all need forgiveness, forgiveness
We all need forgiveness, forgiveness
We all need forgiveness, forgiveness

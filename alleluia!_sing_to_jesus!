Alleluia! sing to Jesus! His the scepter,
His the throne.
Alleluia! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark! the songs of peaceful Zion
thunder like a mighty flood.
Jesus out of every nation
has redeemed us by His blood.

Alleluia! not as orphans
are we left in sorrow now;
Alleluia! He is near us,
faith believes, nor questions how;
Though the cloud from sight received Him
when the forty days were o'er
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
I am with you evermore?

Alleluia! bread of angels,
here on earth our food, our stay;
Alleluia! here the sinful
flee to you from day to day:
Intercessor, Friend of sinners,
Earth's Redeemer, plead for me,
Where the songs of all the sinless
sweep across the crystal sea.

Alleluia! King eternal,
You the Lord of lords we own;
Alleluia! born of Mary,
Earth your footstool,
Heav'n your throne:
You within the veil has entered,
robed in flesh our great High Priest;
Here on earth both priest and
victim in the Eucharistic feast.

I want the joy of the Lord to come down
I want the joy of the Lord to fall now

I want the joy of the Lord in my life
I want the joy of the Lord to lift me

I want the joy of the Lord to change me
I want the joy of the Lord in my life

It's time I started dancing Over all these graves
It's time I gave You,
Oh my Lord, 
The highest praise

It's time to lift my voice…
And beg for 
This blessing to fall…

I want the joy of the Lord to come down
I want the joy of the Lord to fall now

I want the joy of The Lord in my life
I want the joy of The Lord to lift me

I want the joy of the Lord to change me
I want the joy of the Lord in my life

It's time I started dancing Over all these graves
It's time I gave You,
Oh my Lord, 
The highest praise

It's time to lift my voice…
And beg for 
This blessing to fall…

I want the joy of the Lord to come down
I want the joy of the Lord to fall now

I want the joy of The Lord in my life
I want the joy of The Lord to lift me

I want the joy of the Lord to change me
I want the joy of the Lord in my life

I want the joy of the Lord to come down
I want the joy of the Lord to fall now

I want the joy of The Lord in my life
I want the joy of The Lord to lift me

I want the joy of the Lord to change me
I want the joy of the Lord in my life

I want the joy of the Lord to come down
I want the joy of the Lord to fall now

I want the joy of The Lord in my life
I want the joy of The Lord to lift me

I want the joy of the Lord to change me
I want the joy of the Lord in my life

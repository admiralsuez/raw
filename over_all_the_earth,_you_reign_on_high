Over all the Earth, You reign on high,
Every mountain stream, every sunset sky!
And my one request, Lord my only aim,
Is that you reign in me again!


Lord reign in me, reign in your power,
Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour.
'Cause you are the Lord, of all I am,
So won't you reign in me again!

Over every thought, 
	Over every word, 
May my life reflect, 
	The beauty of my Lord.
'Cause you mean more to me, 
	Than any earthly thing,
So wont you reign in me again.

Lord reign in me, reign in your power,
Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour.
'Cause you are the Lord, of all I am,
So won't you reign in me again!

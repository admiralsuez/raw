Though I may speak with bravest fire
And have the gift to all inspire
And have not love, my words are vain
As sounding brass, and hopeless gain.

Though I may give all I possess
And striving so, my love profess
But be not giv'n by love within,
The profit soon turns strangely thin.

Come, Spirit, come, our hearts control,
Our spirits long to be made whole
Let inward love guide every deed;
By this we worship and are freed

We remember how you loved us to Your death,
And still we celebrate for You are with us here.
And we believe that we will see You
when you come in Your glory, Lord.
We remember, we celebrate, we believe!

Verse 1
Here, a million wounded souls
Are yearning just to touch you and be healed;
Gather all your people, and hold them to your heart.

Verse 2
Now we recreate you love,
We bring the bread and wine to share a meal;
Sign of grace and mercy, the Presence of the Lord.

Verse 3
Christ, the Father's great "Amen"
To all the hopes and dreams of every heart;
Peace beyond all telling, and freedom from all fear.

Verse 4
See the face of Christ revealed in every person standing by your side.
Gift to one another and temples of Your love.

Lord Jesus, I long
To be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever
To live in my soul.

Break down every idol,
Cast out every foe -
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow, yes,
Whiter than snow –
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, look down
From Your throne in the skies
And help me to make
A complete sacrifice.

I give up myself
And whatever I know -
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow, yes,
Whiter than snow –
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, for this
I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord,
At Thy crucified feet.

By faith, for my cleansing
I see Your blood flow -
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow, yes,
Whiter than snow –
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, before You
I patiently wait;
Come now and within me
A new heart create.

To those who have sought You,
You never said “No” -
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow, yes,
Whiter than snow –
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow, yes,
Whiter than snow –
Now wash me and I shall be
Whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, I long
To be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever
To live in my soul.

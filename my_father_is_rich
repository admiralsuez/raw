My Father is rich
In houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth
Of the world in His hands!

Of rubies and diamonds,
Of silver and gold,
His coffers are full,
He has riches untold.

I知 a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I知 a child of the King.

My Father痴 own Son,
The Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth
As the poorest of them;

But now He is reigning
Forever on high,
And will give me a home
In heaven by and by.

I知 a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I知 a child of the King.

I once was an outcast
Stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice,
And an alien by birth;

But I致e been adopted
My name痴 written down,
An heir to a mansion,
A robe, and a crown.

I知 a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I知 a child of the King.

A tent or a cottage,
Why should I care?
They池e building a palace
For me over there;

Though exiled from home,
Yet still I may sing;
All glory to God,
I知 a child of the King.

I知 a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior,
I知 a child of the King.

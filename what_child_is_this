What Child is this,
Who, laid to rest,
On Mary's lap is sleeping?

What Child Is This?

Whom angels greet
With anthems sweet
While shepherds watch
Are keeping?

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard
And angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christian, fear;
For sinners here
The silent Word is pleading.

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard
And angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, 
Gold and myrrh, 
Come, peasant, king, to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard
And angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

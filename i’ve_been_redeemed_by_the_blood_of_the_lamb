I'VE BEEN REDEEMED (ECHO) BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB (ECHO)
I'VE BEEN REDEEMED
BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB  

SAVED AND SANCTIFIED I AM;
ALL MY SINS ARE WASHED AWAY,
PRAISE THE LORD

AND THAT'S NOT ALL (ECHO)
THERE'S MORE BESIDES, (ECHO) (REPEAT)
AND THAT'S NOT ALL  THERE'S MORE BESIDES, 

I WENT TO THE RIVER AND I GOT BAPTIZED, ALL MY SINS ARE WASHED AWAY,
PRAISE THE LORD

YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ME (ECHO)
ALL THAT YOU PLEASE, (ECHO) (REPEAT)
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ME ALL THAT YOU PLEASE, 

I'LL TALK ABOUT WHEN I AM ON MY KNEES;
ALL MY SINS ARE WASHED AWAY,
PRAISE THE LORD

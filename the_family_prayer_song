The Family Prayer Song
(As For Me And My House)

As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord;
As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord.

As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord;
We will serve the Lord!

As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord;
As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord!

As for me and my house,
We will serve the Lord;
We will serve the Lord;
We will serve the Lord!

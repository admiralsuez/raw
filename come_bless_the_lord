Come bless the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord,
Who stand by night, in the house of the Lord;
Lift up your hands, in the Holy place,
And bless the Lord, and bless the Lord.

O taste and see that the Lord is good,
O taste and see that the Lord is good,
O taste and see that the Lord is good,
Blessed is the man who trusts in Him.

He lifted me up from the miry clay,
And set my feet on the rock to stay,
He put a song in my heart to sing,
A song of praise, a song of praise.

The Lord is my Light
And the rock of my Salvation
Whom shall I fear
The Lord is my Light
And the rock of my Salvation
Of whom shall I be afraid.

I offer up to you a sacrifice
I will sing praise with 
your name
For you have conquered all my enemies
You are God of my Salvation
Oh...Oh...heaven is in 
my heart.

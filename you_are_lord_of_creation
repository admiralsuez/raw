You are Lord of creation and 
Lord of my life.  
Lord of the land and the sea!
You were Lord of the heavens, Before there was time,
Lord of all Lords You will be!

We bow down and 
We worship You, Lord!

Lord of all Lords You will be!


You are King of creation and

You were King of the heavens, Before there was time,
King of all Kings You will be!

We bow down and 
We crown You the King!
We bow down and 
We crown You the King!

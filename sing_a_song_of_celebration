Sing a song of celebration, 
lift up a shout of praise,
For the bridegroom will come, the Glorious One!
And oh, we will look on His face,
We’ll go to a much better place

Dance with all your might, 
Lift up your hands and clap for joy,
The time’s drawing near, 
When He will appear
And oh, we will stand by his side,
A strong, pure, spotless bride!

We will dance on the streets that are golden.

The glorious bride and the great Son of Man,

From every tongue and tribe and nation

Will join in the song of the Lamb

Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near
Sing aloud for the time of rejoicing is near
(echo)
The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear
The risen King, our groom, is soon to appear
(echo)
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb
Lift up your voice, proclaim the coming Lamb
(echo)

We will dance on the streets that are golden.

The glorious bride and the great Son of Man,

From every tongue and tribe and nation

Will join in the song of the Lamb

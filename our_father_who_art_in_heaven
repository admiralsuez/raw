Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those, who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil 
Deliver us, Lord, from every evil                And grant us peace in our day.
In your mercy keep us free from sin                And protect us from all anxiety
As we walk in joyful hope                For the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ
 For the kingdom,, and the power -  and the glory are Yours,
Now and forever, amen. Amen.

God is so wonderful,
I can’t explain,
But I can say, “Glory Hallelujah!
Praise His holy name!”

Oh, God is so wonderful,
I can’t explain,
But I can say, “Glory Hallelujah!
Praise His holy name!”

It’s wonderful because He saved me,
It’s wonderful that He forgave me.
It’s wonderful, wonderful,
So very wonderful,
Wonderful that He is mine.

I cast on Him my every burden,
Lay at His feet my every care.
It’s wonderful, wonderful,
So very wonderful,
Wonderful that He is mine.

Oh, God is so wonderful,
I can’t explain,
But I can say, “Glory Hallelujah!
Praise His holy name!”

Oh, God is so wonderful,
I can’t explain,
But I can say, “Glory Hallelujah!
Praise His holy name!”

Almighty, most Holy God,
Faithful through the ages! Almighty, most Holy Lord,
Glorious, Almighty God!


The beasts of the field, the birds of the air
Are silent to call our Your name.
The earth has no voice and I have no choice ,
But to magnify God unashamed!
Let the rocks be kept silent for one more day.
Let the whole world sing out.  

Let the people say:
Well, time marches on with the innocence gone,
		And a darkness has covered the earth.
But His Spirit still dwells; He speak, “It is well.”
And the hopeless still offered offered new birth.
He will break the lease of death;
It will have no sting.
Let the pris’ner go free! 
Join the dance and sing!

Almighty, most Holy God,
Faithful through the ages! 
Almighty, most Holy Lord,
Glorious, Almighty God!

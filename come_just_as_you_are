Come just as you are;
Hear the Spirit call.
Come just as you are;

Come and see,
Come, receive;
Come and live forever.

Come just as you are;
Hear the Spirit call.
Come just as you are;

Come, receive
Christ the King
Come and live forevermore.

Life everlasting,
And strength for today;
Taste the Living Water
And never thirst again.

Come just as you are;
Hear the Spirit call.
Come just as you are;

Come and see,
Come, receive;
Come and live forever.

Come just as you are;
Hear the Spirit call.
Come just as you are;

Come, receive
Christ the King
Come and live forevermore.

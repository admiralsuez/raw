Jesus Christ is Lord -4 
He is enthroned on righteousness
He is enthroned on Justice

His Blood has overcome
The enemy of our soul
He is the Mighty deliverer


The walls will
come down
Thru' our
shout of praise

The walls will come down
Thru' our shout of joy

The walls will come down thru' our shout of triumph 
To our Lord God Almighty-2

With the sword of the Spirit in our hands
The word of God in our mouth

With the blood of Jesus 
To set us free 
We have the victory

The heavens must roll back
As people of faith arise
Declaring the authority

We have in Jesus Name
Demonic forces bow Devils stand aside
You have no power you are finished

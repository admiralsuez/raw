On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry 
Announces that the Lord is nigh; 
Awake and hearken, for He brings 
Glad tidings of the King of kings.  
 
2. Then cleansed be every heart from sin; 
Make straight the way of God within; 
Oh, let us all our hearts prepare 
For Christ to come and enter there.  
 
3. To heal the sick stretch out Thine hand, 
And bid the fallen sinner stand; 
Shine forth, and let Thy light restore 
Earth's own true loveliness once more.  
 
4. All praise, eternal Son, to Thee, 
Whose advent sets Thy people free; 
Whom with the Father we adore  
And Holy Ghost forever more.

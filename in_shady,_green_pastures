In shady, green pastures
So rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;

Where the water’s cool flow
Bathes the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.

Some through the waters,
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire,
But all through the blood;

Some through great sorrow,
But God gives a song,
In the night season
And all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount
Where the sun shines so bright
God leads His dear children along;

Sometimes in the valley,
In darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Some through the waters,
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire,
But all through the blood;

Some through great sorrow,
But God gives a song,
In the night season
And all the day long.

Though sorrows befall us,
And Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;

Through grace we can conquer,
Defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Some through the waters,
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire,
But all through the blood;

Some through great sorrow,
But God gives a song,
In the night season
And all the day long.

Some through the waters,
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire,
But all through the blood;

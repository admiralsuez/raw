I am the Bread of life,
You who come to me shall not hunger;
and who believe in me shall not thirst.
No one can come to me
unless the Father beckons.

The bread that I will give
is my flesh for the life of the world,
and if you eat of this bread,
you shall live for ever,
you shall live for ever.

Unless you eat of the
flesh of the Son of Man
and drink of his blood,
and drink of his blood,
you shall not have life
within you.

I am the Resurrection,
I am the life.
If you believe in me,
even though you die,
you shall live forever.

Yes, Lord, I believe that
you are the Christ,
the Son of God,
Who have come
into the world.

Chorus
And I will raise you up,
And I will raise you up,
And I will raise you up
on the last day.

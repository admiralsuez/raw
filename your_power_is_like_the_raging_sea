Your power is like the raging sea,
Your grace brought it down to me;
And now I walk in victory,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!

Blessed be the Lord,
A Mighty Fortress,
Blessed be the Lord,
My Sword and Shield;

Blessed be the Lord,
Who reigns, victorious,
Blessed be, blessed be
The name of the Lord.

A Mighty Fortress,
Blessed be the Lord,

Your blood set this captive free,
Your love is giving life to me;
And now I’m Yours eternally,
Blessed be the name of the Lord!

You are exalted Lord above all else!  

We place You in the highest place above all else!

Right now where we stand and everywhere we go, 
We place You in the highest place so the world will know!

You are a mighty warrior,
dressed in the armor of light,
Crushing the deeds of darkness, 
lead us on in the fight!

Through the blood of Jesus, victorious we stand,  

We place you in the highest place, above all else in this land!



You are exalted Lord above all else!  

We place You in the highest place above all else!

Right now where we stand and everywhere we go, 
We place You in the highest place so the world will know!

You are a mighty warrior,
dressed in the armor of light,
Crushing the deeds of darkness, 
lead us on in the fight!

You are exalted Lord above all else!

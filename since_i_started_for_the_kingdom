Since I started for the Kingdom,
Since my life He controls,
Since I gave my heart to Jesus,
The longer I serve Him,
The sweeter He grows.

The longer I serve Him
The sweeter he grows.
The more that I love Him,
More love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven,
My heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him
The sweeter He grows.

Every need He is supplying,
Plenteous grace He bestows;
Every day my way gets brighter,
The longer I serve Him,
The sweeter He grows.

The longer I serve Him
The sweeter he grows.
The more that I love Him,
More love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven,
My heart overflows,
The longer I serve Him
The sweeter He grows.

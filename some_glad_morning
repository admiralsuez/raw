Some glad morning
When this life is over,
I'll fly away;
To a home on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O glory,
I'll fly away;
When I die,
Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows 
Of this life have gone,
I'll fly away;
Like a bird from prison bars has flown,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O glory,
I'll fly away;
When I die,
Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away;
To a land where joys shall never end,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O glory,
I'll fly away;
When I die,
Hallelujah, by and by,
I'll fly away.

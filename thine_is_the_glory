Thine is the glory,
Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.

Angels in bright raiment
Rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes
Where Thy body lay.

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.

Lo! Jesus meets us,
Risen, from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us,
Scatters fear and gloom;

Let His church with gladness
Hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth;
Death hath lost its sting.

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.

No more we doubt Thee,
Glorious Prince of Life!
Life is naught without Thee;
Aid us in our strife;

Make us more than conquerors,
Through Thy deathless love,
Bring us safe through Jordan
With Thy power and love.

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conquering Son;
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.

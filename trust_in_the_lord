Trust in the Lord
Lean on Him
Don't be afraid
For God is near

Never ever give up
God is on the throne
He will never leave you
Nor forsake you

Miracles will happen
When you trust Him
Never fear
God loves you

Mary was in tears
Martha was in fear
Jesus walked in there
Brought Joy everywhere

He is my refuge
He is my strength
Very present help
In my trouble

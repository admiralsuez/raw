1.  Yesterday has gone on the wings of tomorrow
Dreams of you and me, a fading memory.
Oh ---- sweet spirit in me - Oh ---- sweet angel set free
 
Chorus

And her beauty had a place not for this earth,
She chose to offer up her life for love
But her spirit hovered gently at her birth
She'll always go on loving - sending kisses from above

 2.  I held her little hand, and touched her little face.
Precious body of a girl, a spirit full of grace.
Oh --- sweet spirit in me -    oh ----sweet angel set free (repeat Chorus)
Bridge
Oh ---- divine, Oh --- divine, oh -- Child of mine.

I can do all things through 
Christ who gives me strength.
But sometimes I wonder 
What He can do through me.

No great success to show, 
No glory on my own.
Yet in my weakness
He is there to let me know:

His Strength is perfect
When our strength is gone.
He'll carry us
When we can't carry on. 

Raised in His power,
The weak become strong.
His strength is perfect;
His strength is perfect.

We can only know
The power that He holds
When we truly see how deep
Our weakness goes.

His strength in us begins
Where ours comes to an end
He hears our humble cry
And proves again:

His Strength is perfect
When our strength is gone.
He'll carry us
When we can't carry on. 

Raised in His power,
The weak become strong.
His strength is perfect;
His strength is perfect.

Raised in His power,
The weak become strong.
His strength is perfect;
His strength is perfect.

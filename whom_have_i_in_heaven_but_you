Whom have I in Heaven but you?
There is nothing on earth I desire,
Beside You.

My heart and my strength,
Many times they fail;
But there is one truth
That always will prevail.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever, forever.

Whom have I in heaven,
But You?
There is nothing on earth I desire,
Beside You.

My heart and my strength,
Many times they fail.
But there is one truth
That always will prevail.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever.

God is the strength of my heart,
God is the strength of my heart;
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever, forever,
Forever, forever, forever.

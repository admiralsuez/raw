Trade your heavy heart 
For a heart of joy,
Celebrate what God has done;

Join the song of praise
 As we gather here,
Celebrate the Lord of Love.

Jesus is our Lord,
He is reigning here,
We declare,
“His kingdom's come;”

Darkness has to flee,
In His holy light,
Celebrate the Lord of Love.

All creation sings,
Hear the oceans roar;
Let the earth proclaim 
That Christ is Lord.

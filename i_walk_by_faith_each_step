I walk by faith Each step by faith
To live by faith I put my trust in You
I walk by faith Each step by faith
To live by faith I put my trust in You

Every step I take Is a step of faith
No weapon formed 
Against me shall prosper
And every prayer I make
Is a prayer of faith
And if my God is for me
Who can be against me

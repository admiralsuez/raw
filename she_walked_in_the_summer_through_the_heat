1.  She walked in the summer through the heat on the hill. 
      She hurried as one who went with a will.  
      She danced in the sunlight when the day was done. 
      Her heart knew no evening Who carried the Son.

2.  Fresh as a flower at the first ray of dawn, 
     She came to Her cousin whose morning was gone. 
     But there leapt a little child in the ancient womb 
     And there leapt a little hope in every ancient tomb.

3.  Hail, little sister, who heralds the spring. 
     Hail, brave Mother, who carries the King. 
     Hail to the moment beneath Your breast. 
     May all generations call You blessed.

4.  When you walk in the summer through the heat on the hill, 
     When your wound with the wind and one with His will - be brave 
     with the burdens you are blessed to bear, for it's Christ that you carry 
     everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.

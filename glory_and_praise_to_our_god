Glory and praise to our God, who alone gives light to our days.
Many are the blessing he bears to those who trust in his ways.

1. We, the daughters and sons of him who built the valleys
and plains, praise the wonders our God has done in every
heart that sings.

2. In his wisdom he strengthens us, like gold that's tested in
fire. Though the power of sin prevails, our God is there to save.

3. Every moment of every day, our God is waiting to save,
always ready to seek the lost, to answer those who pray.

4. God has watered our barren land and spent his merciful
rain. Now the rivers of life run full for anyone to drink.

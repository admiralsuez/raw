1. I'm trading my sorrows.
I'm trading my shame,
I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord.
I'm trading my sickness.
I'm trading my pain.
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.
Bridge: We say Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord.
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord.
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord. Amen!
2. I am pressed but not crushed,
persecuted, but not abandoned;
Struck down, but not destroyed.
I am blessed beyond the curse,
for His promise will endure
that His joy's gonna be my strength.
Though the sorrow may last for the night.
His joy comes with the morning.
I'm trading my sorrows.
I'm trading my shame,
I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord.
I'm trading my sickness.
I'm trading my pain.
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord.
Bridge: We say Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord.
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord.
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes, yes Lord. Amen!

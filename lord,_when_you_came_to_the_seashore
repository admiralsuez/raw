Lord, when you came to the seashore
You weren't seeking the wise or the wealthy,
But only asking that I might follow.

Lord, you knew what my boat carried;
Neither money nor weapons for fighting,
But nets for fishing, my daily labor.

Lord, have you need of my labor,
Hands for service, a heart made for loving,
My arms for lifting the poor and broken?

Lord, send me where you would have me,
To a village, or heart of the city;
I will remember that you are with me.

Chorus
O Lord, in my eyes you were gazing,
Kindly smiling, my name you were saying;
all I treasured, I have left on the sand there;
Close to You, I will find other seas.

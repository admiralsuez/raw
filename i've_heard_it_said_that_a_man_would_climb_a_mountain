I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain
Just to be with 
the one he loves

How many times has he broken that promise,
It has never been done
I've never climbed the highest mountain, 
But I walked the hill of Calvary

Just to be with You,
I'd do anything
There's no price 
I would not pay

Just to be the you,
I'd Give anything
I would give
my life away

I've heard it said
that a man would 
swim the ocean
Just to be with
the one he loves

All of those dreams
are an empty notion, 
It can never be done
I've never swam the deepest ocean, 
But I walked upon the raging sea


Just to be with You, 
I'd do anything, 
There's no price 
I would not pay
Just to be the you, 
I'd give anything,
I would give my life away

And I know that 
you don't understand 
the fullness of My love
How I died upon the cross 
for your sins

And I know that you don't realize how much that 
I gave you
But I promise, 
I would do it all again

Just to be with you, 
I've done everything
There's no price 
I did not pay
Just to be with you,
I gave everything
Yes, I gave my life away

I gave my life away;      
Just to be with you, 
Just to be with you, 
Just to be with you

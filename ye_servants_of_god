Ye servants of God,
Your Master proclaim,
And publish abroad
His wonderful Name;

The name, all victorious, 
of Jesus extol;
 His kingdom is glorious
He rules over all.

God ruleth on high,
Almighty to save,
And still He is nigh,
His presence we have:

The great congregation
His triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to
Jesus, our King!

Salvation to God,
Who sits on the throne!
Let all cry aloud,
and honor the Son;

The praises of Jesus
The angels proclaim,
Fall down on their faces
and worship the Lamb.

Then let us adore, 
And give Him His right,
All glory and power 
All wisdom and might,

All honor and blessing,
with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing,
and infinite love.

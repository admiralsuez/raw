1.     Just let me say, how much I love You, Let me speak of Your mercy and grace. 
Just let me live in the shadow of beauty.  Let me see you face to face. 
And the earth will skake as your words go forth 
And the heavens can tremble and fall. 
Just let me say how much I love you. 
O my saviour, my Lord and Friend.

2.     Just let me hear your finest whispers, as you gently call my name. 
And let me see your power and your glory, let me feel your spirits flame. 
Let me find you in the desert, till this sand is holy ground. 
And I am found completely surrendered. 
To You my Lord and Friend.

3.     So let me say how much I love you, with all my heart I long for you. 
For I am caught in this passion of knowing, this endless love I've found in You. 
And the depth of grace, the forgiveness fouind, to be called a child of God. 
Just makes me say how much I love You, O my Saviour, my Lord and friend.

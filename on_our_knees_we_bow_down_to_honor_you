On our knees we bow down 
to honor You this day.  
in our hearts we long to make a new song with our praise.  Unto You we offer all 
we offer all


On our knees Lord we 
honor You for, 
all of Your mercy.  
Lord You are holy.  
Almighty God, hear our cry, Holy Holy is the Lord.

I've watched You come 
and bless this life of mine. 
 I thank You here 
with holy hands up high.  
And I know there's even more in what's unseen, 
Lord draw me near.  
Lord draw me near.

On our knees Lord we 
honor You for, 
all of Your mercy.  
Lord You are holy.  
Almighty God, hear our cry, Holy Holy is the Lord.

Almighty God, Almighty. 
 Holy is the Lord

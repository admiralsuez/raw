But until then,
My heart will go on singing.
Until then, with joy, I'll carry on.
Until the day, my eyes behold the 
Savior;  until the day
God calls me home.

My heart can sing
when I pause to remember.
A heartache here, 
is just a stepping stone.
Along the trail,
that's winding always upward,
This troubled world 
is not my final home.

But until then,
My heart will go on singing.
Until then, with joy, I'll carry on.
Until the day, my eyes behold the 
Savior;  until the day
God calls me home.

The things of earth,
will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed 
for a while.
And things of earth 
that cause the heart to tremble
Remembered there,
will only bring a smile.

But until then,
My heart will go on singing.
Until then, with joy, I'll carry on.
Until the day, my eyes behold the 
Savior;  until the day
God calls me home.

This weary world,
With all it's toil and struggle
May take its toll of misery and strife
The soul of man is 
Like a waiting falcon
When it's released,
it's destined for the skies.

But until then,
My heart will go on singing.
Until then, with joy, I'll carry on.
Until the day, my eyes behold the 
Savior;  until the day
God calls me home.

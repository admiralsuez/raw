Think about His love.
Think about His goodness.
Think about His grace
That's brought us through.

For as high as the heavens above
So great is the measure 
Of our Father's love.
Great is the measure 
Of our Father's love.

Think about His love.
Think about His goodness.
Think about His grace
That's brought us through.

For as high as the heavens above
So great is the measure 
Of our Father's love.
Great is the measure 
Of our Father's love.

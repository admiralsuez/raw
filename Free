Gonna tell the world what he did for me

Don't worry
Don't cry
That's a voice I hear inside
But it's hard for me to see
Tomorrow's but a dream
'Cause today's reality is right in front of me

They say you'll never make
They say you can never change it
What you are is what you'll always be
They say that I should give up
Once you're down you'll never get up
But that's not the truth for me
No!

Who the son sets free
You best believe it's free indeed
Wanna take it to the streets
My Lord Delivered me

Who the son sets free
You best believe it's free indeed
Wanna dance and shout and scream
I'm free indeed!

I've tried and tried and tried
To make this mountain step aside
Or to climb it on my own
But what you did has more than helped
Do what I couldn't do myself
You said that I was not alone

Then I thought I'd never make
Then you can along and then you changed it
Made a way somehow and brought me through
As I was just about to give up
You took me hand said baby get up
Now here I am because of you
Stand beause of you!

Who the son sets free
You best believe it's free indeed
Wanna take it to the streets
My Lord Delivered me

Who the son sets free
You best believe it's free indeed
Wanna dance and shout and scream
I'm free indeed!

If you need a friend to the very end
To be there by you side
To get you through the hard times
The dark times of your life
To bring you into the dawn
He's the one your lookin for
Your Savior
Your deliver

Lord delivered me

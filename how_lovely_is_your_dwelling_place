How lovely is Your dwelling place,
 O Lord Almighty
My soul longs and 
even faints for You


For here my heart is satisfied,
 within Your presence.
I sing beneath the shadow
of Your wings

Better is one day in Your courts,
Better is one day in Your house,
Better is one day in Your courts, than thousands elsewhere!

(repeat)

One thing I ask and I would seek; 
to see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells 

(repeat) 

Better is one day in Your courts,
Better is one day in Your house,
Better is one day in Your courts than thousands elsewhere!

(repeat)

One thing I ask and I would seek; 
to see Your beauty
To find You in the place Your glory dwells 

(repeat) 

Better is one day in Your courts,
Better is one day in Your house,
Better is one day in Your courts than thousands elsewhere!

(repeat)

My heart and flesh cry out,
for you the Living God.
Your Spirit’s water for my soul.
I’ve tasted and I’ve seen, 
come once again to me.
I will draw near to You,
  I will draw near to You... 


Better is one day in Your courts,
Better is one day in Your house,
Better is one day in Your courts than thousands elsewhere!

(repeat)

Maybe tomorrow I'll start over
Maybe tomorrow I will finally change my ways
Said the same thing yesterday
Don't know why I'm so afraid
To let you in
To let you win
To let you have all of me

I can't live my whole life wastin'
All the grace that I know you've given
'Cause you've made me for so much more than
Sittin' on the side lines
I don't wanna look back and wonder
If good enough could've been better

Every day's a day that's borrowed
So, why am I waiting for tomorrow?
Why am I waiting for tomorrow?

Maybe today I'll start believing, yeah,
That your mercy really is
As real as you say it is
It doesn't matter who I used to be
It only matters that I've been set free
You rescued me, you're changing me
Jesus, take everything

I can't live my whole life wastin'
All the grace that I know you've given
'Cause you've made me for so much more than
Sittin' on the side lines
I don't wanna look back and wonder
If good enough could've been better

Every day's a day that's borrowed
So, why am I waiting for tomorrow?

Oh, I'm making this my moment now
To grab the hand that's reaching down to save me,
Oh, You save me
And I'm making this my moment now
To grab the hand that's reaching down to save me
Oh, You save me

I can't live my whole life wastin'
All the grace that I know you've given
'Cause you've made me for so much more than
Sittin' on the side lines
I don't wanna look back and wonder
If good enough could've been better

Every day's a day that's borrowed
So, why am I waiting for tomorrow?
Why am I waiting for tomorrow?

I'm gonna grab the hand that's reaching down
And I'm not gonna wait until tomorrow
Oh, tomorrow

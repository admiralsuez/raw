The King is born
This day in Bethlehem
Hallelujah - Ha....
No Crown is won - but Angels worship Him

Almighty God so peace on might
Salvation comes through dis Holy Child

A King is born
He's in the manger now
A King is born
Humbly come and
Humbly bow

A King boy stretched His tiny hands
A King is born on this day in Bethlehem
